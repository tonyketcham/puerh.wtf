description: An ancient, wild-growing *Assamica* varietal (sometimes known as
  *Assamica Dehongensis*) that may even predate the pervasive *Da Ye Zhong*
  varietal. *Ye Sheng* packs a fucking punch in the *cha qi* realm and that
  punch usually connotes to a particularly wild taste, with some burly lemony
  purple-like fruity/floral notes. Those flavors and effects likely come from
  *Ye Sheng*'s catechin content, which may be naturally present in this wild
  varietal to defend against insects and other predators from consuming the
  leaves. Humans seek and savor stress and danger.
