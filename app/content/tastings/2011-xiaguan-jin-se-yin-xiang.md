### Infusions

1. The mouthfeel is a bit watery but very lubricating. The flavor is strong in woody sweetness with some fall-like spices. Some spicy cannabis herbaceous notes lead into the finish. Overall tastes quite sweet, with a huckleberry-like flavor and sweetness. The finish isn't very intensely flavorful but notably has a lingering buzz and menthol-like nature.
2. Chocolatey wood, barley, peat. Bright and sweet aromas with some cascara tang. The cha qi is hittin me sideways like a rusty cart outside a grocery store on a warm but not hot early summer day around 5pm after you just picked up some beers and pretzel roll buns.
3. Smooth cacao nibs with some dark chocolate and wooden bitterness.
4. Huitlacoche, rice hulls, fermented rice for sake.
5. Peat moss, hug from grandma, searching for things in the forest, receiving verbal praise from those whose opinions matter to you.
6. Tobacco and sweetened cardstock.
7. The aftertaste of sweet corn, roasted wood prior to it charring.
8. Sunflower seeds, sweet varnish.
