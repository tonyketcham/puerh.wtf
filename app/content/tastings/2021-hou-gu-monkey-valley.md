### Synopsis

This tea is savory and nutty. It was baked with a wood fire which brings out more of the soft nuttiness. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky with an oily coating throughout the mouth. Congruent with all the Mao Fengs I've tried so far, this one has a crab-like flavor to it and a chalky, dry finish. I find this particular Mao Feng to be softer and easier on the stomach than some with stronger umami and punch to them. This one still retains a lot of that umami with a chestnut-centric flavor, accompanied by kombu and roasted vegetables.

The body thickens more as the session progresses, jointly bringing out more astringency and bitterness in the finish.

On the fourth infusion, things are creamier and juicier.

Overall quite good and one of my favorite Mao Fengs I've tried.
