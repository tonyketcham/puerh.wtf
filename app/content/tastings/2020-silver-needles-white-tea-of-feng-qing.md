The buds felt velvety and soft like holding a little bunny while I was weighin em out on the scale.

### Infusions

1. Spicy floral notes that are delicate and very pleasant. Woodsy with some fruit juice; a tiiiiiny bit vegetal. No dryness. Cinnamon, tarragon, lemon juice, a tiny bit of egg yolk
2. Toasted pumpkin seed, anise
3. Some familiar hay-like white tea flavors coming out, smooth and a bit syrupy
4. Honey and early summer flowers, warm rain
5. Rolling spice notes through the mouth, reminds me of Indian food, a bit of potpourri
6. A little cinnamon roll somethin
7. More melding and diving into an area of a bit less discernment but enjoyment still ensues
