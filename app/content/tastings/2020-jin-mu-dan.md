This is a small-batch, medium-roast yancha in the Jin Mu Dan (Golden Peony) style. I'm not nearly as well-versed in oolong as I am in puer, but the point of this project is to learn!

### Infusions

1. Smooth mineral slickness, velvety light and smooth mouthfeel, milk chocolate, floral brightness. The roast is dialed in and balanced for a soft and nonabrasive experience. The finish is mid-length and carries much of the same flavors.
2. Stronger charcoal and bittersweet chocolate notes with some vegetal/umami gyokuro aspects in the finish. Nice body feeling with cold extremities. There's a robust and warm, round flavor that's reminiscent of dessert on a cool night.
3. Faint aroma of yellow beets, tart strawberry, toasted Italian bread. The finish has a juicy hops and baked goods taste.
4. More astringency, remarkably soft and pleasant mouthfeel.
5. ...
6. Lighter and creamier.
