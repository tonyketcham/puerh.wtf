### Synopsis

From smell, you'd think this tea would taste way more humid. The smell of the wet leaf comes through in flavor with some oomph. I'm greeted with a sweet, dark woody note that reminds me of large forest growth. A bit of a purple note hidden within dark chocolate wood. From there, a medium touch of bitterness rolls in with a shroud of astringency that leaves a lasting sensation of fizz and moments later, *huigan*. This has a delayed *huigan* for sure, in that it tricks you with sweetness before the bitters.

This tea packs tons of flavor even on quick infusions, where it's a bit more gentle and easier to split apart taste-wise. 

Some bright and crackly mineral notes shoot through here and there, and I notice some earthier peat notes. A nice tannic profile intermingles with the earthiness.

The qi on this is probably my favorite type of qi feeling from a tea - a bit like couch lock and comfy CBD-like melting with a body-wide relaxation.
