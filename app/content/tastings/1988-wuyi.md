### Synopsis

Strongly rounded out roast with caramelized milk, walnut + nutmeg, and a gentle outfield tart fruit sensation like muddled raspberries or overripe blackberries. Minty finish with malt, a lifting berry note, and a light touch of astringency. The mouthfeel is quite luxurious in tandem with the soft flavors. As the finish draws out, I notice more of a defined peanut brittle flavor.

There's a soft but lingering mineral backbone to the nuts and creams. Incredibly tasty - anyone would love this tea. This tea particularly brings back memories of my childhood at my _oma_'s (German grandmother's) house. There's a soft but pungent spicy, nutty roast that smells exactly like her house.

This tea reminds me quite a bit of a rougui or a milan dancong. Particularly its lively floral/berry side on top of roasty/spicy malt, with a less-forward minerality than you typically encounter with yancha. The minerality comes back with a bit of vanilla in the finish.

As the session progresses, cinnamon becomes a more dominate note with more humid spice/wood notes overtaking and replacing the defined berry notes from the beginning. LP accurately describes this tea as having a Rolo-like taste.

The end of the session is honey-forward and creamy.
