description: >-
  The most popular cultivar in Shizuouka, named after where it was grown for the
  first time: *Yabu* - bamboo grove, and *kita* - the north. Yabukita is also
  the most popular cultivar in Japan, making up 77% of the cultivars used
  throughout the country (impressive when considering that there are up of 3000
  cultivars in use throughout Japan).


  The cultivar was first created by Hikosaburo Sugiyama of Shizuouka in 1908, not catching on in popularity for nearly half a century until it was registered in 1956. The strain is frost-resistant but fungal-prone. It's popular for its high yields and pleasant umami.
