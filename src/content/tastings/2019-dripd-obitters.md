notes:
  dry_leaf_nose: old ass musty wood, petrichor, dank antique store, 4H art show in a barn
  wet_leaf_nose: funky aged woods and moss, dried corn husks, farm storehouse,
    what I imagine aged chenpi to smell like
  mouthfeel: smooth as a cat's ass & thick as a bear
  taste: cookie dough milkshake, light angostura bitters, old wood house, dried
    citrus peel
  finish: smooth as hell, drawn out with light camphor in later steeps
  empty_cup: a tad bit smokey, dark earth
  cha_qi: man i don't even know but it's good

Yea this is a funky smellin one.

### Infusions

1. Incredibly, incredibly smooth. Almost tastes like a cookie dough milkshake. Some woods and an integrated bitterness when looking beside the cookie dough. The smell hasn't really come through to the brew surprisingly. It's got some of that dank woodsiness but it doesn't taste like an elder farmer yet. As it cooled, more of a medicinal bitterness but a gentle, soft one.

   Separated this steep into two cups and the one that the tail-end of the pour contained was WAY more bitter, but slathered on top of the smoothness. Funky monkey Friday

2. Medicinal & creamy soft bitterness that coats the mouth. Kind of like angostura. A bit of that old flavor is coming through. Still sweet cookie dough. Impressively smooth. Nice bits of spice and umbery things. Gentle, old wood.
3. Same as the last round but even smoother. Deep, thick, and dope.
4. Think it's getting even smoother. Tastes like summer and winter at the same time. A bit of camphor on the finish.
5. Damp old wood, dried citrus peel
6. Steeped the fuck out of this one, it's intense on that medicinal bitter smoothness. Soy milk sugar cookie. This is definitely a unique experience that I recommend you summon a sample of over at [white2tea.com](white2tea.com)
