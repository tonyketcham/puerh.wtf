### Infusions

1. First impression is that this tastes very adult-like. It's got a pretty potent but pleasant astringency as well. There's a bit of a chalky feeling in the mouth on the teeth. Strong on the rye whiskey barrel wood notes, slightly souring wood as the liquid cools a bit. Tons of complexity that make it feel like you're looking into an old-growth forest with tons of brush, tryna spot somethin small, brown, n furry. The mouthfeel on the finish is a bit bubbly and slightly cooling.\
   \
   It tastes like a clean, quiet, and calm workshop of old heavy tools - perhaps even a speakeasy. Definitely more towards the Old Fashioned front if you were to compare this to a cocktail. Flavors are malty and smooth with a bit of chocolate milk.
2. A bit sweeter and brighter in flavors, definitely bolder with a semblance of a cacao nibs note. There's a substantial nutty malt tied to a woodiness and spiciness with a touch of cream, stone, and florals. Kind of an all-arounder save for vegetal; any vegetal notes are more in the earthy realm, like raw potatoes. I'm picking up a bit of loam, but it's not anything like that big wet-stored soil note (which tend to make me, personally, feel a little nauseous) - this is more chocolatey, deep, and full. Lots of bass in this tea. Also freeze-dried corn notes.
3. Malted milk balls, deep wood, astringency. Feels like a class act all around. Super clean tasting and lively with rounded out minerality poking through here and there. It's a fun time and has a nice predominance of that malted milk ball flavor above the woodsiness.
4. More noticeable raw potato, heightened sweetness, still carrying that malty complexity.
5. Smoother with less astringency. Hard to pick stuff out to describe it, but this infusion has some nice honeyed dianhong-type notes to it augmented onto the potato earthiness. That potato taste is more refined and clearer than before. The taste is similar to red beets as well.
6. Stored grain flavors are taking the stage now. Tastes like smooth malt or sticking your face into freshly toasted grains.
7. Steeped longer, it's a ton earthier than before. Doesn't get bitter which is cool, but gets some clay-like flavors coming out.
8. Floral grains and nuts. That creamy, interwoven, dry-aged sheng flavor. Cashew milk, lemon zest.
9. ...
10. ...
11. Now it's starting to switch up with a lot more umami. Kombu and wakame flavors are coming out which is really unexpected. When the umami subsides, a taste of melted chocolate (like on a s'mores) comes up.
12. Candied lemon and seaweed
