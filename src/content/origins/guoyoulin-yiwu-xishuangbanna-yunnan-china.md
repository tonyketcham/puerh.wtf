description: >-
  A protected national forest located deep in Yiwu containing many old arbor
  trees, this area used to be home to tea farmers. In order to establish the
  protected forest, the government paid to move these farmers to another village
  and cut a deal with them that allows a few of the farmers to come back to the
  secluded forest twice a year to harvest tea. Therefore, material from
  Guoyoulin is limited but typically very high quality. 


  Tea from Guoyoulin tends towards a characteristic soft Yiwu profile with bright aromas, thick & balanced body, and an impactful finish.
