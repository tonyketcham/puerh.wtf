description: >-
  A purple tea varietal that began in 1985 when a uniquely purple tree (buds,
  leaves, and stems) was found growing within a large tea plantation.
  Propagations were then made of this tree which has spread in cultivation
  around China, India, and Kenya.


  The anthocyanins in this varietal contribute a significant bitterness which can be curtailed in post-fermented processing methods. Therefore, this cultivar is not typically used in sheng making. The characteristic flavors of this varietal are strongly fruity, with a thin body. To alter that thinness, processing material from these trees into shou or black tea can typically thickens out the body.
