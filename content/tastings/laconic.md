### Infusions

1. Very herbaceous and up front with some bitterness and astringency. Some complex, oily soupiness that feels quite spicy. Cooling and minty finish with a peachy aftertaste.
2. Super nice balance with a peaches n cream feel. The bitterness is toned down to almost null, really fitting in nicely. The finish is nice.
3. Oilier with even less astringency. Not as balanced as the last infusion but it's fantastic in a different way. Sweet and floral while still being spice-forward. Long and persistent cooling mouth sensation in the finish.
4. ...
5. Still holding quite similar flavor wise with a bit more astringency.
6. Oily as a bear!
7. Quite brothy/soupy with some mint that connects the finish.
