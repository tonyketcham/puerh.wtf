### Infusions

1. Very herbaceous and upfront with some bitterness and astringency. Some complex, oily soupiness that feels quite spicy. Milk Duds. Cooling and minty finish with a peachy aftertaste.
2. Super nice balance with a peaches n cream feel. The bitterness is toned down to almost null, really fitting in nicely. The finish is smooth and a bit papery or woody. Some bright Meyer lemon notes. Lifting spicey herbs.
3. Oilier with even less astringency. Not as balanced as the last infusion but it's fantastic in a different way. Sweet and floral while still being spice-forward. Long and persistent herbal cooling of the mouth & throat in the finish. Nice touch of *huigan* as well. I love these types of finishes in sheng.
4. Sweeter with a more sticky mouthfeel. Very drinkable and easy to just down a cup real fast.
5. Still holding quite similar flavor-wise with notably more astringency.
6. Oily as a bear!
7. Quite brothy/soupy with some mint that connects the finish. Gettin savory and still smooth as hell. Vaporous and herbal out the wazoo.
8.
