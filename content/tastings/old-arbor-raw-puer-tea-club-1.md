### Synopsis

The initial taste is quite nutty and grain-like with bright herbs and clean floral and mineral notes. There's a noticeable trait of fine flour, oats, and similarly soft-tasting grains alongside Herbes de Provence. 

More bitter with each steep and quite sencha-like with an apricot, intense *huigan* finish. A little weedy, too. 

Mineral-forward and bitter, in a tantalizing way. There's an odd medicinal, grassy, tart kind of flavor in the aftertaste that I'm (Tony) not a huge fan of, but that might transform with some more age. Currently it kind of reminds me of a funky playdough? The first time I tried this tea a few months ago, the grassy, off flavor I didn't like was very intense. Now it's definitely mellowed and the minerality has more of a sweet balance.

The further in we get, the more sweetness this tea has - particularly noticing coconut sugar.

Bitter spring water with an astringent pull towards the finish.
