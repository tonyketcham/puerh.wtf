The identifiable baked goods in the nose of the leaf are neat. There's a solid banana aspect but on the other side backed up against it you get this pancakey syrupiness, which goes with the name.

### Infusions

1. The liquor is even rather syrup colored off a 10-sec infusion. Light, bright, and smooth with a curling aftertaste that grabs at some type of floral cream spice and jumps into Irish soda bread. The taste is very sweet and reminiscent of pancakes, vanilla, other baked goods.
2. Picking up some berry jam, more earthiness, more really ripe banana good things
3. The leaf is much sweeter and ripe smelling. Stronger mineral springwater flavors. Flavors are very balanced with nothing offensive or challenging. Just a good time for an even gooder price. I'm definitely gonna pick up a whole cake.
4. Tending towards a general, very smooth & clean shou flavor set with a balanced complexity that seems like a good averaging in terms of the blend of material used. I think most people across the spectrum would enjoy this, from Lipton drinkers to those who keep multiple pumidors.
5. Deep, sweet, and bready. Reminds me of rum cake.
6. Thick with notes of french bread, cocoa powder, oak. The tea's universally transforming toward a more earthy path which is pretty cool. Typically I've found that different categories rise and fall across the spectrum but this is like a more weighted flavor shift, pickin up the house and moving it down a block.
7. it's good and I did more here, so this is worth like 5 steeps in one bullet point and it's good so just know that it's good
