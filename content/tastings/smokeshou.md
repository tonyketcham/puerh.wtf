### Synopsis

After the first infusion, this tea carried a relaxing pine smoke aroma that gently filled up my tea consumption zone. The first taste is very different from anything I've experienced - it's almost reminding me of an earthy and chocolatey barbeque.

There's something primitively relaxing from this tea that's making me feel loose and social. It's got a bit of an alcoholic characteristic like scotch - perhaps a bit peaty.

As the session moves on, the outright smokiness tones down into something of a background context. Chocolate breads follow with malt and smooth texture. This tea finishes with a light smoke, chocolate granola, and juiciness around the mouth with astringency on the roof of the top of the tongue - even a bit of a *huigan* in there. The empty cup reminds me of being besides a campfire eating smores.
