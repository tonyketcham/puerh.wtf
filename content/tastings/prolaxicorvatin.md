### Infusions

1. Light on the thickness, heavy on the florals. A highly pleasant, rounded flavor that has chocolate milk notes to it. I think most people would enjoy this flavor.
2. Some light astringency with strong sweetness. Also, some burly bitters that actually feel quite rounded into that chocolate milkiness; now with a bit more of a resinous woody aroma. I'm noticing a sweet aftertaste that reminds me of banana bread. There are also these floral concord grape flavors that have a falling sensation into the finish.
3. Big sweets. Rock candy for sure. Tastes kinda like sweet cream with a touch of burliness behind it. There's some cooling woodiness in there with minerality.
4. Comparing against w2t's tasting notes from 2016, the age has for sure changed this into a people pleaser of a tea. Though it can come through quite astringent steep to steep which may dissuade some people. I'd say this one might pass the mom test.
5. The broth has thickened up quite a bit. The body's carrying more bitterness as well than previously.
