I don't know what's been up but for the past few days, every time I go to grab the leaf, I'm puttin in more than 7 grams per 100mL. I think it's like that with habits of consumption in general. But anyway I got to 5g and saw how much was left in the sampler n just said eh I'll dump the whole thing in and see what happens. So here we are.

### Infusions

1. Right after an intensely oily and coating mouthfeel, the name of this tea gets smacked into my face. It's stone milk. It's like this super fatty milk that's entangled with old ass metamorphic rock. This tastes like the roots of the tea trees were just pullin up the flavor of rocks where some mountain cows were goin wild shootin milk everywhere all day, right next to some berry bushes being pollinated by some big bumble bees and it just put all that in the leaves. I'm definitely picking up some blackberries and blueberries with a bit of an adult flavor - kind of alcoholic. There's a slight sweet & sour mineral note towards the top of the mouth that seems separate. The more you drink, the stronger the cream note is. It's wild how it has the throat-feel of milk too.
2. Pretty spot on in line with the first one I gotta say
3. A bit more acidic but pleasantly so. The milk notes have subsided a tad, but there's a strong mineral note that's a bit ambiguous but definitively stone. The roast on this one is noticeable - more so than the first two rounds. The finish has a cardamom and nutmeg note with a slightly roasted vegetation. Strong summer-like tastes.
4. Notably drying throughout the mouth with a bit of a chalkiness. Still strong on that roast note with some newer bready notes.
5. Pulled back more on the bolder part of the spectrum, letting the delicate floral notes come out. 
6. Had a bunch more steeps off the record here without many transformative aspects save for the longer steep times bringing out the cream notes that had subsided. Could infuse for a real long time without any bitterness or feeling of overbrewedness.
