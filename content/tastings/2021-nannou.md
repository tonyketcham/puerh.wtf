### Synopsis

My initial reaction is complex, minty cream with a full flavor and feeling, especially in the finish. The aftertaste is persistent, sweet, minty, and herbaceous.

The next infusion is pointedly more bitter where none existed in the first. That bitterness is balanced well and accompanied by some dryness. It beacons a dry *huigan* that has weedy herbals and fruit rind.

The wet leaf smells dope. Very good and also nice. The next few steeps follow a similar profile towards a collective full-bodied *sheng* flavor. Highly drinkable and the throat flavor is intensely good.

Reminds me a bit of Irish soda bread in the best way possible.

Further in, the tea is stupidly sweet and sugar-piled. There's a full, complex flavor and mouthfeel that's herbal.
