### Synopsis

Incredibly fruity, floral, and thick. Has some sheng-like smoke particularly adjacent to a Xiaguan-like character supporting a ton of bright, fun aromatics. Just smelling this shit is gettin me goin. I literally can't stop. After killin the first cup, I'd 365g this shit instantly if I could.

This white tea drinks like a good young sheng and has some of that spicy apricot/holy basil character, especially in the finish. We got peach rings up in the chat. Yunnan is where it's at. This tea's nicely balanced.  

Smokey bittersweet, chalked full of volatile aromas with a mirrored reverb of celery (soup mode) in the finish. 

Steepied this sucker for a bit longer and brought out a good bit of astringency and zest. The peach rings vibe is immense. Kinda has an incense/candle thing to it as well. This shit is GOOD yo. The aftertaste is awesome with a touch of umami. This thing's got it all (in terms of what I'm into).

Becomes creamier and drier deeper into the session.

Moon Bear is goated.
