On first infusion, I was taken aback by the amount of expansion on the leaves. They fully unfurled from their dry state. The taste was also incredibly pleasant with heavy floral notes, sour gummy action, and a sweet umami. I got pulled into a meeting after finishing the first cup, and noticed that I can still taste the ghost of that sour note more than 30 minutes later - very nice.

Second infusion, that sourness sneaks up in a really fuckin cool way. Haven’t had a TGY with anything near this much sourness before, and I’m very into it - it’s done right; not at all overwhelming, but rather an interesting layer to the experience that allows you to appreciate all the floral notes and the body of the tea outside of that sourness. Long sentences aside, I can’t help but keep coming back to smelling the wet leaf between sips.

This is likely different from any oolong you’re used to - if all these discriptors remind you of something else, shoot me a recommendation because I’m trying to drink it ASAP.

Third infusion, still holding that floral note in the same spot, the sourness toned down a bit until the liquor cooled, then it was brought back intensely. Switched to a deeper, narrower cup to pay more attention to the flowers, noticing more jasmine. I wouldn’t fault you for thinking this is a scented tea there’s so much aroma going on.

Fourth, noticing more of the background scaffolding of the body. That mashed potato, buttery umami works into the whole perfectly, no conflict at all. Vegetal notes are more so tubers than greens. Starting to feel this tea in my head more, maybe it’ll work its way up to an ass-kicker? In my personal experience, I’ve found it’s important to have something in your stomach when you go into a TGY session but everyone’s milage varies.

If you’re a fan of flowers and sour candy, give this a shot.
