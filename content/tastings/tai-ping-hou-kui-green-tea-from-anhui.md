### Infusions

1. Mouthfeel is juicy, light, and refreshing - very cooling. The taste is packed with umami and savory notes of crab and a warm ocean breeze with flowers. The finish is minty and warming, leading to a mineral green bean-like flavor. It's rather short and also has a slight melon flavor like honeydew. A bit tingly on the tongue.
2. Wet leaf took on a dandelion aroma, sugarsnap peas, a bit less crab, perhaps more like straight up glutamates and wet sea salt. Taste is much creamier. Wildly different than the first infusion. A lot more fruit and florals. Tastes like you just ate a refreshing Mediterranean meal on a warm spring day and stuck ur face in some flowers. Has a very Mediterranean spice/flavor profile. Kind of miso soup-like on the finish. A bit drying whereas the first infusion was barely.
3. The wet leaf is more of a lime green and has a fresh floral laundry aroma to it. Taste is vegetal and buttery with some iron-like mineral notes. Super solid on the umami still. Stronger on the watermelon rind. This would be a very solid daily drinker if you're into Chinese greens.
4. Creamy and a bit tangy, big on the florals. Wet leaf has a bit of a jasmine smell.
5. Descending down to its deathbed. A quick punch in the left asscheek with caffeine, feels like a Red Bull. Nice and creamy, still pleasant to casually drink while doing other stuff.
