The dry leaf has a coriander and cardamom center surrounded by plums, raw honey, deep red stone fruits.

### Infusions

1. The wet leaf has a lot going on. There's some spicey funk. I initially got this clean hotel smell, which might be pretty vague but let's roll with it. Lots of Christmasy, deep spicy smells with some dark raisins. Immediately noticed that 20 sec per the suggested parameters really over-brewed this with my distilled spring water which is unfortunate. I'm going to try [this water recipe](http://empiricaltea.com/my-custom-water-recipe-for-tea/) written by a fellow tea drinker much more knowledgeable than I. They claim that this recipe can resolve the issue of easily overbrewing Chinese black teas. When I do that, I'll toss in an update.\
   \
   Looking past the overbrewedness, I'm noticing a light but pleasantly spicy aged note. The finish is sustained and nice. The cooled down wet leaf is really exciting me, giving way to a strong coriander.
2. This round, I did a bit less water and 10 seconds of infusion which seemed to work better for me. That funkiness reminds me of the sweet and aromatic side of a Thai red curry, perhaps the galangal and coriander + the sweet aftertaste of the paste. It's definitely got a basis in honeyed, deep, red mulled fruit notes but with a subtle intrigue. This is a good tea, but I'm wondering if I set my expectations really high and it's not exactly meeting the hype.
3. The wet leaf has a strong floral honey aroma, as does the taste of the liquor.
4. Definitely noticing brandy and aged wood. Now I want to taste a similarly aged dianhong to compare the effects of this aging. I'm glad I managed my expectations and took a second to just appreciate this for what it is, because now it seems like more of a session-level *huigan* in that I struck down all expectations from initial disappointment, and now the experience is growing into much more of where I had set my expectations.
5. Hay, jujube, still brandy and wood.
