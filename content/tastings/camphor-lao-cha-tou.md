The smell in the bag is particularly spicy and camphor-y; uniquely different from all the other teas I've tried so far.

### Infusions

1. The wet leaf from the rinse smells like barrel-aged whiskey, maraschino cherry, and reminiscent of a museum or ship. There's also a steamed vegetable scent on the lid, and a noticeable earthy wood. The wet leaf from the first infusion has an added buttery component to the aroma, also kind of like a rubber scent. Lots of funky, earth things in here. The wet leaves are also black and super lustrous. Pickings are mixed, with a few ends of branches, stems, and mixed leaf in there.\
   \
   Man what the fuck this is different. It's stupid smooth and coating in a way that feels like cream but doesn't taste like cream, but it's still sweet. It's earthy and woody in a way that tastes like a nice museum. It's got an intense minerality that tastes like less standard mineral flavors I've typically found in tea. Like very soft and slightly tangy minerals, a light touch of chlorine, some gypsum, silica. There's a light salt aspect that intensifies the flavor similar to sprinkling salt on watermelon. There's also a rubber taste like the smell of standing in a car repair shop with all those Goodyear tires stacked up to your side. And reading a lot of what I'm saying has this feeling that I'm conveying it in a way that's off-putting but this stuff is dumb interesting, I'm loving it. This is a weird one for sure (in a dope way). As far as the finish, there's a lifting, increasingly fruity umami that widens and dissipates into resting softness.\
   \
   Also noted the slightest bitterness in the taste that's covered up by the smoothness and abundance of earthy flavors. Perhaps there's a brazil nut, black walnut, or some obscure nuttiness in there that's close to that rubber tire smell-taste but in the nut world.
2. This is gas. It's dope as shit and also fuck. Kinda has like a mulch umami and a coffee bean aroma behind some aged dark fruit thing. This tastes significantly older than 2 years of age. The Taiwan storage on this must be quite aggressive. Noticing cool breath like I just took a sip of sprite after chewin some 5 gum makes my front teeth all sensitive and shit.,..,.. This one's actually gettin me goin I'm actually revved up as a dog and a bear and also a small all-terrain-vehicle. Also kinda tastes like how a garden center smells and I'm itchin to go home n water my plants.
3. Noticing more of the bitter profile and the camphor spiced aroma. Kind of a slight smokiness too. Tree bark.
4. Nuttiness is more pronounced with hazelnut and a supporting minerality behind it. Some funky wood and varnish, good stuff. Drying on the tip and top of the tongue on the finish.
5. Rubber and spices, kind of like the smell of new sneakers. The mouthfeel is intense and ties well into the flavor with a strong cream-like sensation. Granite, petrichor, mint.
6. Intense mineral/stone smell on the leaf and brew which translates to the taste. Very pleasant with a clearer brightness than previous infusions. Rose bush.
7. Long brew times leading to incredibly viscous mouthfeel, creamy. More floral notes.
