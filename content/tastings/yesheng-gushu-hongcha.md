### Synopsis

The first wet leaf after the rinse was super fruity. After the first brew, it totally changed towards the smell of the [Florist Lapsang](https://puerh.wtf/sessions/2020/12/florist-lapsang/) with an almond and licorice profile. The leaves went from black to dark maroon. 

The flavor is complex, savory, minty, and powerful with a bubblegum aspect to it. The mouthfeel is tingly and slightly numbing.

The ye sheng character is intense and easily makes the tea take on an over-the-top strength even with short steeps at low temps. Almond & incense are strong descriptors of the flavor. The mouthfeel is building but I'm also noticing a bit of a fuzzy headache coming on. Ye sheng can snipe my brain.

Nice and warming on the insides. Definitely picking up on the headache but the tea is good!

Further into the session, the tea smells more floral with bitters in the taste. The aftertaste is licoricey and toasty.

This tea becomes a bit spicier and woodier towards the end with a calmer honey profile. This stuff has some serious longevity to it. This sucker's still kickin after 15 infusions and has the color of a second or third steep on a young sheng. Super sweet and smooth in the mouth.
