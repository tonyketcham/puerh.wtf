smell like summer evening car ride of a 

s,el like gigarette smoker 1 pac

sm like peach while u sit insdie of car while driver smoking 1  pound rolled ciga ret (Open Window passing little field of: non-binary flowers)

We drank the damn rinse and it was creamy as hell with some smoky florals.

### Infusions

1. The smell of the liquor is like you're kissin someone who just smoked a cig. Yet the flavor is nothing like a cigarette - it's got a very strong and complex fruity-floral aroma. There's also a mineral cream. Immediately after swallowing, I (Tony) noticed a Corn Pops kind of thing. A slight astringency.
