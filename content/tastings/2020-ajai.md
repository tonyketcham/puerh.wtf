I sipped the damn rinse and it was creamy as hell with some smokey florals.

### Infusions

1. After the first infusion, the smell of the wet leaf is a bit like you're kissin' someone who just smoked a cig. However, that doesn't carry through to the cup. It's got a very strong and complex fruity-floral aroma. There's also a mineral cream. Immediately after swallowing, I noticed a Corn Pops kind of thing. A slight astringency. The mouthfeel is nice and a bit filmy. The finish is nice and vaporous with some minty, herbaceous lifting.
2. White peach and a field of non-binary flowers. Definitely some honey in there. Very balanced fruit and florals to honey and astringency. Light mineral bitterness.
3. More delicate with a bit of pressure and astringency towards the top sides of my mouth. This infusion reminds me more of Yiwu-character.
4. Much brothier than before with a bit of a punch to it but still easy-going. More umami for sure.
5. Similar to the above
6. Also similar with more of a stone profile
7. Less fruity, still quite floral, definitely soupy. More apparent in sweetness.
8. ...
9. Very sweet and brothy. People pleaser for sure.
10. ...
11. Sweet floral broth with some honeyed fruit in the backdrop. Nice musky finish with herbal notes.
