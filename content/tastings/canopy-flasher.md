The wet leaf smells like steppin out of the airport on vacation to somewhere tropical.

### Infusions

1. Lotsa fuzzy floaters from the downy on the leaf, a bit of a hazy liquor. Some miscellaneous ish on the bottom of the cup on this one but I'm down to get dirty. Very creamy onset without aggression. A mellow bitter follow up. Reminds me of mango sherbet and mochi. Faint flowers behind citrus and tropical fruits. Mineral nature is there and comes out more as the cup cools.
2. Verbena on the leaf, like a floral face cream or lotion. First hit was full *huigan*. Even harder on the passionfruit and mango sherbet. It's wild that tea can have such a wide spectrum. Bit of a saran wrap in the mineral mix to be honest (which is a touch odd) but everything else going on makes that a moot point in my book. The wrapper art for this cake is spot on.  
3. Creamier sherbet, more doughy - the body has more of a floury dough. Feels like she's on the precipice of modulating.
4. Warm summer rain. Nut milk, leather, river rocks & dry stone
5. Getting almost like what I would expect out of a ben shan in how the cream aspect is coming forward juxtaposed with a high aromatic. Black pepper on the finish. Grapefruit + grapefruit bitterness. Each sip is as if I'm being tugged in a different direction between the prominent axes of cool shit goin on.
6. More sweet doughiness, smoothing feeling on the tongue that lasts throughout the mouth.
7. mmmmm good i'd say Nice    i would say: nice + mineral finish with subdued flowers
8. Getting more into the milky territory for sure
9. A little thin and pootering out, but still background drinkable
