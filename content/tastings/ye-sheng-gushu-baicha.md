The aromatics off of this stuff are incredible. It smells fresh off the press and ***intense***. Definitely has that *ye sheng* smell as if it's gonna punch you in the cock. Strongly dank.

### Infusions

1. The mouthfeel is super oily & juicy. There's an immediate bright floral & wild note that echoes the spirit of bitter's past without bringing forth any bitterness. Reminds me of purple *yaobao* with a lemon sorbet, rosy, pine-type flavor. I also get some flavors I'd expect from something like a white peony, like hay or pumpkin seeds. There's seriously a lot going on here and I'm already considering caking up when this drops on white2tea's site. \
   \
   The complexity in the finish and background noise of the body definitely points to that *gushu* material. There's a distinctly high-grade sheng finish with a white peony/*yaobao* twist on it. I'm experiencing a long, sweet, herbaceous finish with a vaporous texture. The aftertaste it leaves me with is like a fruity, floral sugar water. I think there's even some *huigan* in there but I don't feel like I experienced any bitterness to earn it. \
   \
   After a few minutes of letting the aftertaste rest in my mouth, I'm noticing a subtle black walnut note that I thought was interesting & I haven't experienced that flavor as clearly in any other tea I've tried thus far.
2. The wet leaf has more of a muskiness to it than the first time around. There's an aroma reminding me of a clean wet dog tbh but not in an offputting way. There's way more of an intensity to both sides of those *ye sheng* and white peony groups of flavors. Much more burliness and spiciness in the terpene-laden florals balanced against the softness and hay-like bed of white peony. Smells and tastes like there's a lot of catechins in this tea which correlates to an intense cha qi. The black walnut in the aftertaste is **way more** intense this time around.
3. Pushed it a bit on accident, still super smooth but there's a burly wild bite with some bitterness. Otherwise similar to before.
4. ...
5. The wet leaf has more of a smell like the withered grass on the mower in your garage after you mow the lawn. The liquor is also quite golden now. There's a pronounced grapefruit zest bitterness with some minerality. Some purple grape skin in there too. Definitely feeling the buzz in a focused but heady way.
6. Preserved lemon rind.
7. Lemon yaobao all damn day. Bit more herbaceous and verdant in flavor.
8. Some mineral & spicy notes like copper and a smooth saison beer. 
9. Noticing more woody spices with some bitterness and light astringency.

13. Toned down pinewood lemon sorbet *yaobao* clusterfuck. It's good!
