Aged 7 years as maocha before being pressed in 2014.

### Infusions

1. The mouthfeel is substantially oily and followed by a smooth bitter taste. Corn smut holds through in the flavor with some aged wood and sweetness. The finish is a bit reminiscent of tahini in throatfeel and taste.
2. Bittersweet, papery-woody tang with some perceived wet smokiness - some aromas kind of like cultured plant butter and leather with an abundance of spices. On the dry side of storage flavors. Medium-high amount of astringency in the finish. The empty cup smell has an intense molasses smell.
3. Wet leaf's got fertilizer in some fertile topsoil aromas. The flavor is a bit more creamy than the previous infusions. Still strong on the bitterness with some loam notes.
4. Quite smokey and burly with a strong smokiness.
5. Juicier with some banana-like fruitiness.
6. Back to the corn smut with sweet smokiness now featuring gasoline.
7. Smoother with loam more noticeable.
8. ...
9. ...
10. Noticeably creamier like soy milk
11. Even creamier and smoother, starting to thin and take a long ass time to brew
