### Infusions

1. After opening up past the rinse, the smell of the wet leaf is much more spicy gourd-like. Still has that varnish smell. A very peculiar set of aromas coming off this stuff - pretty exciting! \
   \
   The mouthfeel is lightly astringent into the finish with a nice oiliness. Varnish carries through to the cup along with gourd seeds/pumpkin guts. The brew's quite sweet. The finish is minty and refreshing.
2. Smells like I just stained a deck n sealed it. The liquor is super golden. Very varnishy tasting alongside some golden beet flavors. That leads to a long, minty finish with strawberry candy flavors. A really odd juxtaposition, but I'm into the weird shit.
3. This is so different from the past two. Straight up like sugar water with a thick, complex body of aromas. Fruits, spices, woodiness, umami, and vegetal notes are all twirled up together. Kind of also hinting at a sour tanginess here and there. There are some similarities to a good *Huang pian* for sure. I'm sure this would age criminally well.
4. Woodsy, varnishy sweetness n pumpkin seeds. Fruity sweetness on the long finish.
5. Quite similar to the last. Has a strong minty finish that slowly builds, which is different from the roasted Laochapo.
6. Varnish was the predominant thing I still noticed.
