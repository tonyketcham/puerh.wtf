The leaves that comprise this tea are quite odd. There are some with a deep brownish/yellow-green, and others with an almost turquoise/deep green. The stems are then a bright reddish-brown, so there's a lot of color contrast which I've not found in most other teas - particularly not a black tea.

### Infusions

1. The color of the liquor holds a bit of a reddish pink, rose hue. Quite similar to a jin jun mei or the florist's lapsang from w2t. There's a bright floral characteristic sitting atop a honeyed almond base. Noticing elderberry, black currant, and rose. A bitterish, nut skin finish with rose and other swelling florals.
2. It's way thicker and smoother. Much sweeter than the first round as well. Agave/demerara syrup. The aftertaste isn't bitter anymore but still has that nut skin, more obvious on the rose.
3. Super sweet and crisp. More minerality.
4. Like sugar water and rose. Daikon entered the chat.
5. Quite similar to the last one, maybe a bit thinner. Definitely still quite rosy.
