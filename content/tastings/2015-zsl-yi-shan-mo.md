1. Toffee, salted caramel popcorn, linen, velvet, varnished wood. Smooth with no bitterness and very gentle astringency. Some edamame-like vegetal savoriness. This stuff goes down easy with a nice lifting sensation that results in a tingly mouth and throatfeel. Definitely thick in texture, I can feel it go down prominently. The finish is minty, herbaceous, and long-lasting. \

   The subtleties around this tea make it impressive. In taste alone, it's definitely in the Yiwu realm and isn't particularly amazing. The overall experience of sensations culminate to make a greater sum than its parts.
2. Creamier with lots of smooth minerality like silica. Incredibly pleasant mouthfeel. Dark earth to bright cream. Becomes woodier and more astringent as it cools. Cardamom, banana, and starfruit aroma in the finish. I feel like many people would find this to be an enjoyable entry to lightly-aged sheng. \

   Incredible lasting aroma in the back of the mouth and throat. Cooling, and refreshing.
3. River rocks and flint. Light bitterness leading to a juicy sweetness. Nice *huigan*. As the tea's opened up, it's brewing quicker so I need to curve the infusion time to prevent the intensity from increasing. It's at the point of still being enjoyable but any more would feel overbrewed. Pushing this tea shows how high quality it is though. I don't notice anything off about it. There's solid complexity in the body and a powerfully smooth mouthfeel that competes with the astringency. Some of those light aged notes in the form of wood and earth are coming through more readily. This is a tea to devote attention towards while drinking.
4. Took my own advice above and we're back to soft Yiwu character with low astringency but enough to keep things lively. More creams, delicate fruits, and warm spices. Less wood and earth. Some resinous texture and camphor familiarity.
5. Much more spice and smooth minerals.
6. A bit of a tangy spice with summer rain.
7. Strong focus on the throat feeling and finish. The cha qi is intense. Definitely in the espresso realm of amped up. Not anxious at all with a positive mindset.
8. Much creamier with spices and a hint of wood.
9. Cream and softness
10. ...
11. Rounded soft spices, silica, cream.
