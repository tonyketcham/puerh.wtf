The smell of the warm dry leaf takes on a familiar heavily roasted oolong aroma, reminiscent of nearly burnt, crusty bread. No rinse. I'm feelin spicy.

### Infusions

1. The wet leaf aroma has chocolate covered blueberries, the smell of espresso in a coffeehouse, gunpowder, and something kind of like avocado oil - an odd amalgamation of shit that does actually kind of work into something pleasant. Mouthfeel is smooth, oily, and milky. There's a subtle ping of sourness sitting atop a mound of roasted floral cream and gasoline. Pleasantly fitting for springtime.
2. Creamier with more of a burnt vegetal smell. Taste has a charcoal-like sourness against a creamy floral vegetation.
3. Popcorn, sake, and toasted grains.
4. Surprisingly very similar to the mori machi dark tea. Dark and roasty fruit & vegetation flavors.
5. Cranked it up to 205. Bitter roast with a slight metallic touch. Has a full body with a nice fruity finish that's got some strong similarity to lychee.
6. Wet leaf smells very intensely of juniper, got that gin vibe. That juniper flavor also translates nicely to the cup. Decent length on the finish, nothing crazy but it's a good time.
7. The juniper is a bit less forward but still present
8. Cereal milk, oats, honey
9. ...
10. Interesting flavor that's almost in the realm of what I associate with spicy chili peppers, kind of tastes like heat. Mouthfeel isn't as creamy up front but still holds a nice, creamy thickness in the throat. Wet leaf still smells like juniper but isn't as pronounced in the cup.
