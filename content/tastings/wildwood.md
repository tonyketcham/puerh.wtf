Excited to try this tea with Arby's Truth Serum water; this is the tea that Arby, Max, and Glenn used in their Between Two Teapots episode on water.

### Infusions

1. The wet leaf smells more intensely vegetal and cleaner than in the rinse. Kind of reminds me of being in a nice resort lobby somewhere tropical with polished stone floors. The mouthfeel is very slick with minimal astringency. That clean floral smell carries through to the cup accompanied by agave, all followed by the taste of flipping through a new book of thick craft paper. Some lighter stone fruits as well like apricots. The finish is vaporous and highly aromatic, lifting, and cooling. Lots of aromas that remind me of old trees growing on a warm, late-spring day.
2. Very full-bodied taste and tactile experience in the mouth. Mineral smoothness with more vegetal statements than the first round. Predominately floral with orchid tones, followed closely by fruitiness and spiciness. Coriander and cardamom. Menthol cooling on the long, drawn-out, fruity finish.
3. More pronounced astringency with a slight bitterness. Spicy aromatics kind of stick around in the aftertaste. Holy basil in that cloud and carrying into the finish. Empty cup has spicier bright florals, like a spicy orchid and oregano.
4. Cashew milk, holy basil, coriander, cardamom. Decent complexity tying all of those together. Brighter fruity/'blue'-tasting floral note coming up right after I swallow. The finish is now the most aromatic of the 4 infusions.
5. The aromatics in the vaporous finish have shifted a bit to be more floral and stronger in the throat and chest.
6. A slight milk chocolate note appeared here.
7. Not noticing much change this time around
8. Becoming creamier with toned down fruit, still persisting on the florals but they're definitely delicate and not in your face floral.
9. Upped temp to boiling. Light lemon notes, with some savory umami. Thinning in body and profile. Still quite enjoyable.
10. Reaching its end, with gentle fruitiness and creaminess along for the ride. The empty cup here smells like the sea.
