### Synopsis

Back at it again wit da Tong Mode this year on a certified hood classic. This shit hits like some flannel pants, man. Mm . , ,. ,.  yea ok very Nice!

Very Good Tea. I love this guy!!

Boundless experience transmuting the properties of taste, human agency, and culture. Oh Boy! It's a  tea!

The finish on this year is way smoother with some balanced dryness - more like a tapioca flavor.

T reminded me to be funky again on here because That's why I fuckin made this thing and i became little corporate polite nice little Professional analysis words

Ok tbh tho this thing do be havin a very sexy salinity and minerality chillin between some kind fruits. Real gorgeous *huigan* (it hittin). What a nice time. I'd take the whole family to here to this Tea Experience. What a god Damn banger

For $15 this has to be **the best** value cake you can find.
