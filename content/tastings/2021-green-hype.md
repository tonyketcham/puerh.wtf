### Synopsis

The paper is getting little tea sweat spots which signify aging - exciting stuff I truly must say, in fact.

The first infusion was notably creamier than the second, which brought out more bitter citrus, like grapefruit. The second also has some red berry component, like raspberry. Aftertaste here comes with some holy basil.

Third has a notable mineral and hard water aspect with increased astringency in the finish. Eggplant flavor! Eggplant flavor! Eggplant mouthfeel!

Smooth whiskey aftertaste deep into the session.
