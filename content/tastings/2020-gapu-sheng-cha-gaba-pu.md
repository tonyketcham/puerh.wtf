This tea seems to be an interesting find by [LP](https://puerh.wtf/vendor/liquid-proust), coming from a Taiwanese producer and distributor called [GABA Tea (May Zest Tea Co., Ltd)](https://www.facebook.com/mzt.gaba)

### Infusions

1. Greeted by an odd concatenation of aromas like hot chilis, lilac, chocolate, popcorn, raisins, and other sweet vegetal aromas. Has a bit of a new car smell to it. This stuff brews quickly; 10 seconds and it looks like the third infusion already. The flavor is cereal milk and raisin-like fruit with some florals, but a bit muffled.\
   \
   The finish is sweet and a bit astringent. No bitterness so far. The wet leaves have a pink hue to them and are quite dark.
2. The flavors are much richer but still have a certain muted feeling to them. That may be a part of the effects of GABA processing. Some muscatel grape, honey, and plum notes. A bit of maple wood hiding out in there especially as it cools.
3. Kind of an awkward faint chocolate milk taste but vegetal. Definitely noticing my motivation has gone way up and the way to break down a complex task seems readily apparent to me versus this morning everything was fuzzy in my brain-mind. So the cha qi is very positive and motivating although I barely feel it body-wise. Huge impact on my mood and cognition though.
4. Minty and more cohesive in flavor. Still a little awkward.  Some *huigan* chillin out there.
5. ...
6. ...
7. Nuttier with an almond-like profile. Reminds me of almond skin and sunflower seeds. Smoothing out more where I find the flavor much more enjoyable. Definitely loving the headspace this tea puts you in even though it's not my favorite tasting sheng.
