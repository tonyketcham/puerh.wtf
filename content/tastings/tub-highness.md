Daes and I are doin a virtual collab over the cord. She's got the tea, I've got the tea; we're drinkin the tea at the same damn time.

### Infusions

1. Mouthfeel is stupid oily and thick. It's almost like you took a shot of CBD oil and held it in your mouth. Daes said her mouth is wetter than a dog in a bathhouse. Taste is cooked fruits, bits of sour bright fruit hidden in the mix, cherries and plum. Finish is long, effervescent, and fruity with very little astringency, maintaining a lot of that juicy mouthfeel. As it goes on, the finish changes to a floral soft & refreshing face cream that u wanna eat, then to a refreshing spring walk outside after a lukewarm shower with cherry blossoms. There's a pretty stark but subtle transformation here in the finish.\
   \
   Daes states, "it taste like nice lukewarm Day outside walking next 2 bloom flower tree in the morning with dew in the: grass 4 Me".
2. Wet leaf has a sweeter smell to it, more intense on the charred fruit realm - cherries, plums, apricot. Taste is way nuttier, like hazelnut and almond skin. Spices like cumin, potentially fenugreek. There's a bit of pleasant bitterness and the whole feel of the tea has shifted to more of a warm hug-like experience. There's more of a savory note coupled with mineral saltiness and floral wood smoke, a hint of vegetal/floral tobacco. There's a more integrated sweetness at a deep level, where it feels like an undertone but affects the whole thing globally. The finish has more astringency than the first, maybe 2.5-3 notches more. The finish is super sweet with a solid *huigan*, returning much more sweetness than you'd expect for the bitterness. I'd say there's a black cherry note in the finish.\
   \
   Our mouths feel a bit numb and overall we both feel really relaxed and calm - like a muscle relaxer.
3. Super cooling on the first sip and into the finish, quite a standout difference from the past two rounds. There's somethin fucky goin on here and it's definitely mint (a good fucky). Holy basil with a smooth, soft smokiness. There's a much thicker aroma when you breathe, definitely in that realm of holy basil and bright spices. It's also feels very cooling to breathe. There's a sweetness surrounding a focus on spicy, savory, vegetal, and nutty flavors. Cha qi is hittin and it feels like we just took a heroic dose of CBD.
4. Light smoke, mineral bitters with cream. Floral fruity finish with basil, mint, and strawberry.
5. There's an intense throat feel that's minty/basil-like. Taste wise, we're seein mineral, bit fruity, sweet and salty, with a solid creaminess. Astringency is there, quite drying but it waits a few seconds to kick in before gradually ramping up.
6. Smooth and silky mouthfeel, ending in dryness. Taste is akin to like plant-based milk made from almond skins.
7. Went way longer on the brew here. Vegetable broth with a bit of celery.
8. ...
9. ...
10. Watery savory broth with a bit of smokey fruitiness.
