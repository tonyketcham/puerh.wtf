This tea was included as a part of white2tea's March 2021 tea club. Brewed using the [truth serum](http://empiricaltea.com/water-recipe-truth-serum/) water recipe.

### Infusions

1. The smell of the wet leaf is much more toned down on the burly smokiness after the first infusion. The taste is wild. It's intense on the smokiness; smoked paprika, up close to a hardwood campfire on a cool evening. This is a feel-good type of tea that just reminds me of drinkin beers around a fire and not havin a care in the world. There's definitely still some pumpkin seed in here with a touch of varnish, kind of going back more to the stain side. But really intensely reminiscent of smoked paprika.\

   The flavor/mouthfeel combo on this feels denser than the unroasted Laochapo. It's also marginally oilier/thicker with a bit less astringency.
2. There's an even sweeter aroma to the leaves with less smoke now, more fruity like cherries and strawberries. Sweet, smoked fruit flavors in the cup. Minty, sweet, turbulent warmth radiating throughout the mouth. It has a really peculiar sensation that I'm into.
3. Sweet fruits & paprika.
4. Smooth as a dog on a tricycle. Strong pumpkin seed and pepitas notes. Almost a bit chewy.
5. Notably astringent, drying most of the mouth. Slight sourness. Has a different kind of fullness to it than the unroasted Laochapo but both are interesting and good, perhaps just best-suited for different kinds of experiences.
6. Oak-smoked strawberries, flour, almond skin
