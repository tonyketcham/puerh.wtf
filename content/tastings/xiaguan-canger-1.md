### Synopsis

Smooth and viscous with some walnut notes. Some herbaceous, sweet, and nutty aspects come through albeit watery for the time being as this tea is still opening up with its high compression. Some light drying and a distinct tingling effervescence in the finish.

Opened up to a savory herb + woody spices spectrum of flavors, reminding me of black walnut. Some alcoholic bitters and tannic elements laying rest til the liquor cools.

Sweet incense and oud. Very resinous with the feeling of curvy, rounded out smokiness from the past. Burly with a bit of a roasted peppercorn aroma.

Bright *huigan* sticking around with an agave-like sweetness.

Smoother than the 2014 version with a fuller body. Definitely forward on incense, earthy nut/roast and resinous tree sap flavors.

Deep into the session I really enjoy where the flavors have landed. Sweet caramel roundness with coriander, clove, and orange peel - really juicy too with low upfront astringency and pleasant falloff into dryness.
