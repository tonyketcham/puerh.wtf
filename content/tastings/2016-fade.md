### Infusions

1. Incredibly sweet and thick. Like honey and chamomile melted into mountain water. Herby and bordering upon medicinal. Sage, eucalyptus, almond skin. Intense sweetness in the finish, low astringency, no bitterness.
2. Agave with an oat creaminess follow-up and light tang. Herby raw sugar. The finish is chalkier with a sweet soy/oat milk coating. Relatively simple profile and definitely approachable as a lightly aged tea.
3. Smooth mountain water with a mineral presence and a bit of astringency. Easy drinker.
4. All-purpose flour aroma, yeast, floral. Simple and lightly pronounced body.
5. Dates and stronger fruit notes. Otherwise quite similar to before.
6. Chocolatey and a bit of evergreen wood, pine, some softly burnt bitter notes as well.
