### Infusions

1. Thick and ultra-smooth mouthfeel with a floral, verdant arrangement of flavors leading to a long but very vaporous/humid finish that feels like a warm, misty spring. Some flavors that stick out are buttered crab, cashews, and pistachios. The liquor is visibly thick, moving with some jelly-like characteristics.
2. The wet leaf has more of a citrus attribute to its savory side. The flavor is intensely green and lively with some strong sweetness and a bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel is oilier. The finish is more cooling on the tongue, almost icy. The empty cup smells a bit like apples and vegetable flowers.
3. This time has an even stronger floral note to the citrus in the wet leaf. It also smells cleaner and has some spring rain petrichor. Astringency has poked its head out finally, with a bit more of a watery flavor and some slight verdant, umami funk on the finish.
4. Still incredibly smooth and fresh - kind of hard to pin down a specific flavor out of it but it's more on the floral side rather than the musky side of Chinese greens.
5. Dying out into a watery grave. Was a good time while it lasted.
