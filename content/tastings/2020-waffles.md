The liquor's definitely cloudier on this compared to the 2018 version. Got a different set of dry/wet leaf notes that weren't better or worse - just different. The wet leaf was much more savory than the 2018 when hot, and then went into a fruity sweetness when it cooled down.

### Infusions

1. Sweet and smooth. Reminds me of pancake batter or a thick & sweet pancake that's dumb soft and fluffy on the inside. The liquor in the cup smells like intense & quality vanilla ice cream - the kind with the black specs of vanilla bean in it. Has a certain juicy transforming to grippy mouthfeel to it on the finish similar to the evaporation feeling of the 2018. Got the slightest camphor on the finish, too. Has a bit of a 'darker' taste than the 2018, but it's definitely in the same class of even flavor distribution with a focus on clean, smooth, sweetness that's similar to baked goods or pancakes/waffles. Time could likely also be a smoothing/altering factor that could make the 2018 different from the 2020. 

   This tastes kind of like I put cream and sugar into the tea, it's great.
2. Bright notes that remind me of sugar-glazed, flaky puff pastry. Also a spiced baked good like coffee cake.
3. Cereal box papery notes and earth, returning sweetness
4. Pancake syrup, earthy bread, cream
5. Aftertaste of icing, wood-fired bread
6. Noticing some fruits like dark cherries and also breads like the last infusions, less earthy bread though
7. Very fruity and a bit more floral, kind of like cherry blossoms, cherry wood, and damn near cherries themselves
8. This thing can keep going for many a steep but I'm gonna do that in the peace of my laptop, some VS Code, and generative art
