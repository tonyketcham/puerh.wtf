Tried this with two different water temps to see the difference between experiences: 212 degrees and 205 degrees.

### Infusions

1. I'm met with a rounded, tangy smooth/bitter kind of twist. The mouthfeel is oily and luscious - super pleasant. There's a slight woodiness resting towards the back of the tongue tying back to that tangy twist with a hint of smoke. All of those aspects besides the oily mouthfeel are light and noticeable rather than commanding at this point. Some leathery aged notes (think a saloon or museum with antique stuff). Some astringency on the finish but not super intense. The coating mouthfeel exists in the throat as well.\
   \
   **Came back to this with 205 degree water** - got way less bitterness. More chocolatey, kind of like a smooth hot cocoa. Not noticing that smoke note.
2. The wet leaf this time around has a roasted corn, elotes kind of thing goin on coupled with a deep forest type of lively, woody smell. A bit of a wood-fire bitterness with charcoaly hardwood. There's also a nuttiness and creaminess like black walnuts, with a fruity brightness. The empty cup smells like a humid wood sauna with eucalyptus. Some bitter mineral notes as well, although this bitterness is more tied to the woody/spicy side. It could even be perceived as a subtle sourness.\
   \
   **205 degree water:** really fruity and floral with some spicy aspects, like a nice femme's perfume. Creamed woodsy notes with tight astringency. Black walnuts, cloves, tobacco, a bit of charred hardwood. Finding the balance here more pleasant than using water at 212. The bitterness is less so than the other session.
3. Way juicier mouthfeel than before. Honestly has the taste of fire or heat. The body is stronger with an abundance of tang. Long lasting finish.\
   \
   **205 & shorter steep time - around 10s:** Similar increased juiciness but with increased creaminess as well. A bit on the light, hot chocolate milk side. Not noticing that tanginess, but I do notice the stronger body, like the tea has fully opened up at this point. The finish is indeed long lasting and a bit cooling.
4. Leather and stone. Chalky mouthfeel.\
   \
   **205:** same as 212 with more softness and creaminess.
5. A little soupy with a touch of a celery/mushroom note. This tea isn't very sweet, but a limited time sweetness hits pretty decently towards the start with a super smooth minerality, then fades out to be replaced by dryness and woodiness. The astringency is more pronounced now.\
   \
   **205:** Woodsy tobacco kinda thing with some integrated bitterness. Finish is still quite cooling and nice.
6. The wet leaf smells like currants with a 'dark purple'-like smell. Resinous wood with a pronounced but rounded bitterness. As it cools, that bitterness tones down.

   **205:** Wet leaf has that dark purple smell but with quite a bit of bright floral aspects surrounding it. The taste is barely bitter, but is definitely astringent. Some floral woodsy aspects. Retro-olfactory sensation in the throat where deep fruity tones are coming back up from the dark depths.

7. I didn't finish this the first time around at 212 degrees so from here on out, all the words are 205 exclusive. And that's fine, because (in my opinion) 205 is treating this stuff better anyway. Resinous wood and warm spices for sure.
8. Soupier vegetable broth notes. This is interesting to note that at boiling, that came out 3 infusions ago, so the lower temp definitely stretches out the session. Dense hardwood and sugarcane. Airy and savory finish that becomes cooling with a very slight effervescence.
9. Chocolate and grilled wild mushrooms, like chicken of the woods.
10. Soy milk, stone.
