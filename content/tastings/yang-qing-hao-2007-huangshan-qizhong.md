### Infusions

1. I'm met with a rounded, tangy smooth/bitter kind of twist. The mouthfeel is oily and luscious - super pleasant. There's a slight woodiness resting towards the back of the tongue tying back to that tangy twist with a hint of smoke. All of those aspects besides the oily mouthfeel are light and noticeable rather than commanding at this point. Some leathery aged notes (think a saloon or museum with antique stuff). Some astringency on the finish but not super intense. The coating mouthfeel exists in the throat as well.
2. The wet leaf this time around has a roasted corn, elotes kind of thing goin on coupled with a deep forest type of lively, woody smell. A bit of a wood-fire bitterness with charcoaly hardwood. There's also a nuttiness and creaminess like black walnuts, with a fruity brightness. The empty cup smells like a humid wood sauna with eucalyptus. Some bitter mineral notes as well, although this bitterness is more tied to the woody/spicy side. It could even be perceived as a subtle sourness.
3. Way juicier mouthfeel than before. Honestly has the taste of fire or heat. The body is stronger with an abundance of tang. Long lasting finish.
4. Leather and stone. Chalky mouthfeel.
5. A little soupy with a touch of a celery/mushroom note. This tea isn't very sweet, but a limited time sweetness hits pretty decently towards the start with a super smooth minerality, then fades out to be replaced by dryness and woodiness. The astringency is more pronounced now.
6. The wet leaf smells like currants with a 'dark purple'-like smell. Resinous wood with a pronounced but rounded bitterness. As it cools, that bitterness tones down.
