A tea with hot & wild claims that don't line up with its cheap price. In for a fun time.

### Infusions

1. A bit of natural wood-pulpy paper, a very nice astringency tied to a lightly woody bite with brown sugar. A slight tangy component hiding behind the wood and some vegetation. Kind of a very smooth smokiness, very light though. There's a subtle fruitiness especially towards the end that I can't find a comparison to. The finish is quite pleasing; kind of like a lasting fresh laundry aroma.
2. Mouthfeel is thicker with more of a silky aspect that pulls through to the start of the falloff in the finish. Some fresh, light-toned wood (I gotta get into woodworking and figure out what the different types smell like. I'll actually build a chair with someone hmu). There's a spicy floral tang that's reminiscent of a spiced jasmine.
3. Juicy with floral spice that's toned down on the tang. Kind of like a custardy tapioca backing. Dark stonefruits.
4. Bittersweetness with a savory wood umami
5. Reminds me of a whipped lemon cream
6. Quite herbaceous and kind of reminescent of the cookie part of an Oreo
7. Getting that end-game creamy tea taste but with a lot of body to it
