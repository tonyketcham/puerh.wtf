My first impression was that this is a very generous free sample. Enough for 2-3 sessions, and this stuff definitely ain't cheap at \$0.79/g. My order was only 3 samples, too, so that's dope as a dog of them.

This tea hails from the Ding Jia Zhai village in Yiwu

### Infusions

1. The dry leaf is funky. Cold, it was super zesty and fruity. Warm, it's kinda got that wet dog smell?? As it cooled, that disappeared into a more savory fruit, lots of that young sheng smell, spicy minerals, and a bit animalistic but not little doggy in the bath anymore. Grapefruit with sugar.

   Wet leaf is apricot and orchid, smells sweet and thick like a citrus cream. Taste is super creamy with a bit of lemongrass and orchid. Mouthfeel is super thick. Kind of reminiscent of eating an oatmeal raisin cookie. There's a zestiness on the finish and a tingle on the tongue. Lightly astringent. Not at all bitter. There's almost a sour zest but so so so so light that it's not really sour.

2. The texture and body of this tea are more interesting and apparent to me than the independent aromas. It's a lot of sweet, creamy flavors packaged together. There's a floral soft top note interwoven with the creams, balanced against an organic mineral salt. Cardamom, white pepper and clay aroma.
3. Creamy and buttery smooth again. Some delicate aroma on top of a really solid base that's just pleasing to drink. This is 100% a crushable sheng. I think the light age on it toned down the young aggressive bitter minerality often found in sheng hot off the presses. This still tastes super young with a touch of smooth age, so nearly no bitterness. This would also be easily liked by new sheng recruits.\

   Again, hard to describe specific flavors other than using abstractions since the focus of this one is on the mouthfeel and general pleasantry of drinking it. It's business professional in sweatpants.
4. Slightly smokey and gummy. Tanginess on the tongue but more of a sensation rather than a taste. Mineral nature is more present than before, also much more drying on the tongue. Heady cha qi, a little bit like the headspaciness of weed.
5. Slow-cooked citrus notes
6. Some yeastiness coupled with mineral salts
7. Smoother than holdin a cat against ur bare chest after u get out the shower and dry off.
8. Super creamy like soy milk, kind of reaching the end of the road but still very pleasant to drink. I'm honestly wantin to do another session of this.
