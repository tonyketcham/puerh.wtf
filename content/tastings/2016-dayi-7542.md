### Infusions

1. The wet leaf smells much brighter and floral than the dry leaf did. After the first infusion, that wet leaf smells even more floral and sweet. The flavor definitely has some rinse taste in there, so it's a bit muffled and muted. However, I can already tell it's got a smooth, lemony floral nature. A touch of woodiness as well, with some black tea-like honeyed notes. The finish is a bit nutty and chalky. The mouthfeel is smooth and soft with a medium thickness.
2. Some plum and resinous hardwood, mixed in with younger sheng and black tea flavors. Red fruits and honey, slightly bitter bite of young sheng. Very smooth and enjoyable. Some bitterness in the back roof of the mouth precursing some astringency in the finish.
3. More clarity on the woodiness with a pointed focus on that and some floral papery aspects. Honey and date/plum in the background. A bit more astringency which pulls throughout the mouth. The finish is more herbaceous and aromatic. 
4. Less burly and more smooth n sweet. Cha qi is kickin in to feel a bit heady - a bit like a single puff off of a joint.
5. Sweet gentle wildflowers with black tea background noise.
6. Increased astringency, some toned-down fruitiness.
7. Similar to the previous. The astringency is pronounced and definitely fitting for those who like dry wines.
8. ...
9. Sweetness out the wazoo with nice floral fun
10. ... + some sweet vegetables like corn
