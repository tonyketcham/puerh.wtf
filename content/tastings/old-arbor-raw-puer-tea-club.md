The rinse is honestly quite nice. Surprisingly strong flavor with some buddy/trichomey green tea-adjacent notes like fresh grass and pumpkin seeds.

### Infusions

1. The mouthfeel is thick, throaty, and geletinous. Lots of Chinese green tea-like flavors. Notably vegetal. The finish is as bright as it is complex as it is tingly. This shit feels like I just chewed on some pop rocks and spun around 3 times. The tea feels like its flavor follows the shape of a camel's back (2 humps). You get your rise into a vegetal punch with umami, florals, and rounded spices, then a drop-down and another bump up into the finish of tingle and mingle.
2. Deep savory spices in the body alongside chlorophyll, tomato vine, and general complexity. Mint and fenugreek in the finish.
3. Some deep medicinal bitterness. A bit of astringency as well.
4. Soupier with apricot, flour, limestone, and returning sweetness.
5. A bit more gentle and watery but towing complexity. Caramel-like sweetness and holy basil in the aftertaste.
6. Creamier, smoother, and thicker mouthfeel. Chalky astringency on the sides of the mouth.
7. ...
8. Honestly not a huge fan of this one flavor-wise. The cha qi is quite nice and soothing, definitely feels potent with pressure in the head. The flavor is predominately astringent and watery without the sweetness or strong central flavors to balance out that astringency & bitterness. The finish is nice and verdant with cooling yet warm spices.
9. Similar to before
10. Smooth end of life sheng taste with nice mouthfeel going down
