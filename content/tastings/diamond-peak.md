When pouring the water for the first infusion, the leaves were incredibly buoyant and floated in a group above the surface level, outside of the water for a few seconds. I had to give them a little nudge with the lid to submerge the top-half of the leaf.

### Infusions

1. Heavy on the savory vegetal and umami notes for sure. Reminds me of seaweed salad without the vinegar. Very nuanced in that it has a lil sumthin on just about every flavor axis, even if very subtle. These flavors are hard to pick apart in part because of that nuance, and also because it may be something I don't have enough of a frame of reference on to provide direct similarities. Lots of interesting umami messin around with vegetal things and a low hum across the board. The finish is cool and refreshing with some pleasant florals. There's a definite resemblance to Maofeng, especially with the central, higher-frequency aromas.
2. The smell of fresh, wet snow sits on top of the body after the initial impact and leads into the finish. There's some subtle minerality that's difficult to put my finger on. Still a definite roasted vegetable and wakame thing. Almost now getting the aftertaste & feeling of a nice hot chocolate, but much more spice and umami layered in. More like a Mexican hot chocolate. A juxtaposed bittersweetness on the sides of the tongue.
3. May have over-brewed this one a little, as it's a tad more bitter. At the point where I need to take a break to eat something because it's hitting my stomach pretty hard. Getting a lot of the same things as the last cup with a top coat of bitterness.
4. Bitterness was my bad, got it dialed back to how it should be. Noticing pumpkin seeds. Much more florally aromatic, like the smell of lavender soap. The top notes are low-density but present and engaging.
5. Cha qi is relaxing and mildly couch-locking, a tad stoney on the non-psychedelic side.

If you're a fan of Huangshan Maofeng, you'll enjoy this. It's a bit deeper and more delicate - which is reflected in the brewing parameters, too. Would be interesting to try Fur Peak with these brewing params, or even what they would be like blended - Twin Peaks? Stone Peaks?
