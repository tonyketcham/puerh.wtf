### Synopsis

A Raisin Bran flavor in the wet leaf carries into the first sip of the first infusion. There's a sweet and sour akin to dried cranberries. Mouthfeel is elegant and luscious, body flavor is complex, sweet, floral, nutty, and spicy with hints of grains. The type of floral fragrance are more tropical and follow a more orchid-like peach aroma.

The second infusion brings about more of a bittersweetness with much more minerality. The finish is a tad chalky with an interesting *huigan* much more intense than I had expected.

The light age on this adds an interesting bran-like spice and nuttiness that competes with the tropical fruits. The body is appearing a little watery with more astringency in the finish. I think this tea is going to age into something very nice and sweet. Orchid creeps up in the *huigan* after a bit of time passes.

Much more bitterness, returning sweetness, and eventually roundedness with a creamy finish as the infusions progress. 

Guava becomes more noticeable with a decent amount of astringency but I'd say nearly as much juiciness to balance that astringency.
