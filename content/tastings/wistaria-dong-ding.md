### Synopsis

This tea progressively opens up to reveal more floral and vivacious spicy aromas to the nose. The flavor is a tight-bound cluster of tangy, dehydrated red fruits, baked goods, and lightly spiced wood. The finish is incredibly pleasant and refreshing with a bright mint, almost like I just brushed my teeth. After I let the flavor sit in my mouth for a while, it reminds me of rolos. There's a touch of toastiness that has really mellowed and fully integrated with the rest of the flavor suite over time.
