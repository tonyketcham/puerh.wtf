### Infusions

1. This shou holds a good bit of similarity to the Waffles series from white2tea, with a sweet cereal-like brightness and berry features. I would say this has a stronger berry presence than Waffles.\
   \
   Planetary Shark Feed runs quite dark in the cup with flavors reminiscent of sweetened raisin bran, cacao nibs, and sandalwood, coupled with a tinge of bitterness, and some light astringency. There's an oily film-like coating in the mouth. The finish is a dance between drying and oily with some deep bran/cocoa-like notes.
2. Thicker and smoother body with less apparent bitterness and astringency. Flavors seem a bit more clear with less noise while still in that sweet bran realm. The finish has a bit of a menthol kinda thing going on.
3. The liquor is the darkest so far; almost black with deep magentas. Stronger on the woodiness with some savory mineral aspects (a bit of salt and iron). Perhaps a hint of citrus hiding in there as well.
4. ...
5. Still similar, holding onto that raisin bran flavor. 
6. Rather vegetal undertones coming out, like earthier root vegetables.
7. Chocolate, bread, and sandalwood
8. Sweet cocoa, beets
9. Strong sweetness and silky mouthfeel with quicker drop-off of the body in the finish.
