This is specifically for the 2020 Hot Brandy Minis - they may open up differently than the cake version since I'm just gonna throw the ball in and hit it with water.

### Infusions

1. On the first steep, the ball started to come undone a bit and gave off a fresh-out-the-drier laundry smell. Also kinda smells like my cat? In a good way - she usually smells pretty damn good. Tastes kind of like white chocolate with some cardamom and aromatic/soft spices. Reminds me of a whiter Mexican hot chocolate. Very round flavor in that it evenly covers a lot of the main taste categories.
2. Creamier with more honey. Reminds me of golden milk, with the turmeric and everything.
3. More common black tea notes with darker red-tasting(?) white tea stuff. Hard to describe the mixture but it's a good, complex mashup.
4. I love how the large leaves are still so in-tact in these minis. This round is a bit tannic, but I brewed it a bit longer. Burnt caramel, like the crust on a crème brûleé. Liquor from the bottom of the gong dao bei (my 2 fiddy mil pyrex) has this sweet and sour funky thing to it that I only noticed on the first sip of that cup. Neat. The finish has a bit of a tingle to it.
5. This is makin me tweak for a young sheng in a way that this feels like a good appetizer and stomach blanket for something green that'll slap me into another dimension. This is like a comfort blanket or something I'd drink more casually.
6. Malty and pleasant. Kinda falling into just a general smooth tea kind of flavor.
