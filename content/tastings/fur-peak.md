Welcome to my first time with Maofeng. Happily not sure what to expect, which makes sampling without expectations so fun.

The picking and processing both appear visually similar to that of Anji bai cha - young bud and leaf, rolled parallel to the stem with a Y-shape.

### Infusions

1. The wet leaf nose is incredible with such a polarizing nature to its aroma. It's an elusive dank that I can't exactly describe - not farmhouse, but more of a vegetal umami woa. The flavor is strong on toasted, roasted vegetables and french fries, then lighter on green peas and tamari.
2. The leaves after the second steep have more of a linen smell that didn't exist at all prior. There's also much more of that heady dank smell that isn't weed, with a sharper tone and body. The flavor is incredibly rich and intense which I would initially expect to shoot right towards the bitter front, but I can't detect any bitterness. It's building that umami into a loss of words, which has come more front and center with strong supports from roast/nuttiness and vegetals. Florals on the exhaust.\

   This tea gives the impression that shorter steep times and different water temperatures could completely alter its profile.
3. Soft mineral spring water, umami, nori, sushi rice with a touch of tamari, sweet corn on the grill
4. Fried tempura batter, toasty notes of charcoal roast, freshly cut stemmy vegetation, nori
5. Nose is more grass clippings after they've had time to oxidize, taste coming through is pine nuts, fried zucchini flowers, and a bit of a malt that melts in your mouth
6. On the downswing, with similar flavors just thinning out. The finish is long-lasting umami.
