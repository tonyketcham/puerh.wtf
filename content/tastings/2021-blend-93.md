### Synopsis

This matcha brings a balanced verdant profile with pleasant and interesting nuttiness - a mix between pistachio and walnut. Its saline bitterness and astringency is balanced well by ample cream and umami. Towards the second half of the flavor, bridging into the finish, it has a notable softened green bean flavor. This is a well-balanced blend which beacons for a second serving. The aftertaste is drawn out and leaves my mouth coated in a creamy, mineral umami.
