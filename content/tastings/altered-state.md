### Infusions

1. Greeted by a very pleasant mouthfeel. Flavors of cream and forest push through to the sides and front. A gentle bitterness adds pressure to those previous aromas and livens up the experience. Brightness moves up in the finish, evoking a cooling sensation on top of umami-geared notes like steamed edamame, then ending in a light astringency. There's a *ye sheng*-like aroma buried down in the aftertaste, which persists long after the finish.
2. Some smokiness and an oat milk note come out here. Astringency around the teeth and on the tip of the tongue.
3. I can feel a strong headiness and body feeling from this tea. Much, much woodier flavor. Has some strong sweet rice notes with holy basil and almost a rubber-type flavor.
4. Smooth as a dog. Smoky as the bear. Mouthfeel is silica-like. 
5. Creamy and smooth, flavors are definitely in funky oat milk land
6. Heavy oat or soy milk, florals, and pleasant minerality. The qi on this thing's givin me anxiety - it's definitely strong as shit.
7. This blend is insanely smooth.
8. Smooth, fresh rain and a good time. There's not a ton of complexity there but it's one of the smoothest teas I've had in recent times.
