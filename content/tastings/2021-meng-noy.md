### Infusions

1. Clean herbal cream, musky backdrop surrounding the mouth, nutty burliness, mild astringency, tinge of soft bitterness, and a minty finish. Medium thickness.
2. Quite herbaceous with stronger minerality and starfruit aroma. 
3. Nice n smooth with a burly peripheral. A bit of oud or somethin wonky goin on.
4. Fruity n minty huigan with a pleasing body feeling. Cold extremities but focused and calm mind.
5. Medium intensity astringency pulling at the sides of the mouth. Starts sweet, then goes dry, then returns the sweetness. Not too drying nor bitter, while inciting the will to drink more. Very pleasant. The *huigan* sneaks up and provides a nice circular contrast.
6. Much smoother and creamier like oat milk.
