### Synopsis

There are a ton of tiny bud hairs in the brew. My first impression is a medium-to-thicker mouthfeel with an entourage of softness and sweetness. Orchid flavor, rambutan, a bit of leather. Nice huigan and fruity, herbal cooling in the finish. 

Incredibly sweet and floral. 

More infusions in, the brew starts to become dually more bitter as well as creamy, with more astringency. There're now notes of juniper.

Definitely more focused on the vegetal creamy aspect.

Late into the session, this tea becomes bitter cream with some floral overtones. The *huigan* brings back lemongrass.
