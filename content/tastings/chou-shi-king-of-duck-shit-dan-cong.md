### Infusions

1. Tingle on the tongue, nutty notes like almond and pistachio wrapped in an abundance of florals and bright savory aspects. The finish is gentle and longer than many oolongs but shorter than a good sheng.
2. One of my favorite aspects of this tea is the smell of the leaf. It pays well to the experience if you keep smellin your leaves throughout the session. These are very much in the jasmine field of floral aromas, which is one of my favorite smells to sniff. There's a slight bitter note which may be a result of how I'm brewing this, but to me it fits in well with the bright and savory pieces of this tea. I'm noticing more of a crab/scallop like taste in the finish than before.
3. Nut milk, a bit like cashew milk with a nice sweetness
4. Toned down in florals with more cream-like and vegetation notes. Super smooth, a bit drying on the finish.
