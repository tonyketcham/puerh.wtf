### Infusions

1. The wet leaf has a strong varnish or paint smell off the cuff. As it cools, there's a Mediterranean profile of spices. There's a surprising zing type of feeling on the first sip, like a citric acid sugar. That seems to only be present on the first sip. Trying this tea a second run through doesn't produce that zing - probably was washed off the second time. The next notable aspect is the mouthfeel which is smooth and luxurious. Very lubricating. Then, I'm noticing a graham cracker flavor with a bit of a vegetal/woodsy honey. Some of that paint-like flavor is there, too. The finish is bassy with some bright graham cracker aspects while being surrounded by a cooling vapor.
2. Softer than before with a cereal honey type of hug to it. That paint note is still detectable if you pay attention to it, but there's a lot more going on which rewards you for tasting beyond. Mineral water and creamy dark wood. The evolution of honey.
3. A touch of astringency with some sweet, dark wood. Reminiscent of a deep forest in summer.
4. Tobacco and Peychaudâ€™s Bitters. Passionfruit, bamboo, wheatgrass.
5. Big Tobacco, spicy cloud, smokey wood in the shade on a sunny day.
6. Some smokey, wooden bitters with astringency.
