### Infusions

1. This first round is a bit light. There's a powerful minerality lurking with a bright fruity character. The mouthfeel is varied in thickness and texture, with a chalkiness in the coating it leaves behind. The finish is a bit minty and bright while being quite long-lasting. The most notable aspects of the flavor are the spicy aroma that touches on a light woodiness, and the minerality. 

   For me, the cha qi has a quick onset with this tea. It's got a nice muscle-relaxing quality and a cozy, heady body feel. Kind of like you rubbed strong CBD lotion all over your body.
2. A way stronger character full of bitterness and minerality. The bitterness is in the roof of the mouth, top of the tongue, and a bit on the sides of the mouth. There's a white peach and cream aroma behind the minerality. The finish is *huigan*-heavy, spicy, and has a decently strong & long duration.
3. Strong bitterness with a medicinal quality. Tugging, puckering astringency on the sides of the tongue. The minerality ties into a decent umami. This is the kind of tea that hoppy IPA lovers would rejoice with. Personally this tea has a bit too brash of a bitterness for my tastes, but I very much enjoy the resulting *huigan* as well as the cha qi.
4. The tea actually heard me type my gripes and decided to calm down a bit. There's now a nice cream-forward fruit broth that encompases the bitterness and dials it back a bit. Still strong on the astringency, feeling quite tannic. The finish has some coriander notes.
5. Well I brewed it a bit harder and we're back to the medicinal bitters. I can't tell if I love that bitterness or hate it. The *huigan* is consequently a bit more intense.
6. Brewed it softer and I enjoy it more in this realm. I can notice more complexity and the sweetness is intense; I'm guessing that's largely a carryover of the *huigan* in the last round, though. There's a brothy complexity reminiscent of clean rain water, radish, trees, and some indeterminite fruity spiciness.
7. Still strongly medicinal. Notes of honeydew melon and cucumber. 
8. Bitterness is fading more. Astringency is still up there. Has a very juicy texture and feel to it now. Vegetal and fruity. Hoppy. Less mineral.
