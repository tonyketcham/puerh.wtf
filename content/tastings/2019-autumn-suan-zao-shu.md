### Synopsis

Lotsa fuzzies floatin on the top of the first brew of this tea. I really digged the 2020 spring run of this tea from the same garden, so I'm itchin to time travel back a click with this stuff. 

Russet potato, vegetable oil, the slight tingle of bitters, a top layer of astringency, and *maofeng*-like mouthfeel. Definitely flavors I'm used to finding in a *maofeng*. Some sweetness but outweighed by the sensation of astringency and chalkiness. The aroma of fresh rain on a warm day in the finish. As it cools, the flavor creeps more into the nutty stone land with some echoing sensations of late summer flowers.

Second blood and it's deeply veered off towards what the nose suggested and given me almond extract in baked goods with pumpkin spice. If a girl in UGGs comes outta my gaiwan I'm gonna lose it. There's a lot more potency and snap to this tea now, for which I'm endearingly welcoming.

Then this transforms to have a sort of puckering bitterness with that almond character sitting over it.

Metallic minerals progressively worked their way into the flavor around the 5th or 6th infusion.

Things stabilize into a scene of bitter and astringent compounds around the aromatics with faint orange cream and a watery core. At this stage it's a good passive drinker while I'm working but I don't find it to command my attention.
