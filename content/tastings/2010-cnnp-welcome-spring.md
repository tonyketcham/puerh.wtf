### Infusions

1. Sweet corn, fertilizer, nuts, earth, and wood. Tastes like walking in the woods on a gloomy day after heavy rain. The finish is minty and corn-like with a bit of huigan. 
2. More fertilizer - a brasher side of the dankness.
3. Maple cask, clove, loam, lanky kong.
4. Tastes like if you made out with Beetlejuice or sucked on a worm. It's interesting though and I don't hate it. I can appreciate it even though I don't particularly like wet stored stuff.
5. Stronger on the medicinal side.
6. A tied-together, richer brew. There's more cohesion between flavors, forming a complex body. Kind of reminds me of the smell of a slow-moving brook in the woods.
7. Much sweeter and smoother. Some of those brash notes have subsided. Definitely still a loam/wood aspect to it but it's not in your face as much.
