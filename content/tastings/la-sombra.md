### Infusions

1. Mouthfeel is soupy. Sizzle on the tongue. First impression threw me and it's kind of like a zesty, astringent fruit-skin soup. The astringency is soft but very present. The finish is vegetal with floral lifting notes that reach into the spice area with a minty coolness. Very light *huigan*. 
2. Some citronella on the lid of the gaiwan and empty cup here. More zesty aromas comin off the wet leaf still featuring that apricot note. The mouthfeel is softer with more of a followup mineral bitter bite. Oat milk, white grape, coriander. A tacky coating on the tongue and front of the mouth.
3. Holy basil, oregano, and a bit of mint. This turned real spicy and in the wake of that you find fruits and sweetness. Still strong on the astringency with a touch of mineral bitters. The finish is nice and slow.
4. Still real strong on the spices
5. A bit creamier and more sherbet-like, still very spicy. There's a syrupy sweet fruitiness too.
6. Sweet, smooth, yet burly. It's a good time.
7. Vegetable brothy, shiitake mushroom, v creamy
8. Damn near softer than the last one
