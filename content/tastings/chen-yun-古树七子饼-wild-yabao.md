### Synopsis

It's sweet and has a strong sweetness in the aftertaste, almost like stevia. The core flavor and body is pretty hollow though. There are some milky woods and a wintergreen/pine type deal goin on but all a bit watered down at this point. Will have to see if additional infusions opens this tea up.

Silky mouthfeel. A lot more flavor this time around. Hibiscus, a little brown school paper towel (wet). Spicy, caramelized hibiscus in the finish with astringency that nullifies the smooth mouthfeel.

*Shou mei*-like flavors with hay and honey. Not sure how we feel about this tea. It's kind of got an awkward mix of white tea, hollow sheng, and the *yabao* character with age on top of it. A lemon note is coming through more now.

As we steep it out, this is getting a lot better. Way smoother with bright lemon notes. Much more like the sugary, honey profile of an aged white tea.
