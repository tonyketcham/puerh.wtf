### Infusions

1. The wet leaf has a very burly, almost melted plastic smell. That quickly turns into mineral fruit musk, then moves to florals & citrus zest. The mouthfeel is medium thickness with a burly texture to it. The taste is sharp & bitter with apricot and other bright fruity/floral notes which are overpowered by the bitterness & minerality. There's a bit of green pea & celery flavor in the aftertaste, and the bitterness carries through with a sweet overtone.
2. Much better balance now with some sweetness, a touch of saltiness, and more body. I'm noticing warming spices like nutmeg in the flavor. There's a solid *huigan* that's bringing back a strong floral/mineral sweetness with a touch of root vegetables. Also, the throatfeel in the finish is warming, vaporous, and all-around great. I'm picking up some mineral smokiness, too. Some chalky astringency on the top of the tongue and roof of the mouth in the finish.
3. WAY smoother and less intense on the burliness. The *huigan* is dope as shit, some of the most prominent I've encountered in recent times. Much fruitier and sweeter all around. Just enough saltiness to make the fruit smack. Coriander and mint in the finish. The finish lasts a billion years and feels like you just brushed your teeth or used a smooth mouthwash.
4. Smooth minerals with a complex body that's difficult to parse individual notes from.
5. The smell of coffee wafting in the finish. Flavors of pomelo with wheatgrass, spring rain. Floral, highly engaging, minty & fresh *huigan* which makes me want to grab for another cup but hesitant because the lasting flavor is so pleasant.
6. A bit more mineral salty than before. Would pair well with a Saison or Belgian beer, maybe vegan cheeses too. The mouthfeel is heavily oily and thick now. Brothy body. Definitely an intense tea to drink young, would not recommend on an empty stomach. The aftertaste is a bit more aromatic.
7. Mineral water with cucumber and citrus. Strong cardamom aroma in the finish. This tea gets ya jonesed up.
8. Much more vegetal and bitter with a green candy-like aftertaste.
