At last, its 2-month long journey to my house plus an 18-day buffer to air it out with a Boveda in the sheng palace (a double ziplock freezer bag) is complete. I couldn't wait any longer or I'd itch my damn skin off. The Snoozefest is here.

### Infusions

1. Lotta subtle complexity tangled up like some earbuds in ur pocket. There's a sweet n salty nutty component with berries and a bit of pineapple all whipped into an airy cream of some fuckin sort. It's solid. It's got that floral fragrance you want, a minty getup on the finish with this deep, persisting warming in the middle and front of my mouth like when you eat red hots minus the cinnamon death punch.
2. Herbal dryness tight bitterness masked mostly by a floral, spiced-up, creamy, lemon oil smoothness leading the way into a neat *huigan* leaving a light coating feeling on your teeth. Cashews and pistachio on the finish. Can already tell this would be complimented real well with about 5-10 years on it but is a joy to drink now.
3. You can red-line this stuff pretty hard; it responds real well to bein pushed on infusion length. Zesty in a real nice way. Going lighter gives you something much creamier, punchin it goes a bit aggressive but nowhere near that 'over-brewed' taste. Intense astringency but still a pretty gentle bitterness. Real long finish, prolly 2x the length of the last infusion. I'd do some stuff for a tong of this. This is stupid good for a $15 cake and I'm thankful that this clapback of a production's goin hard years after the [inter-vendor feud](https://www.reddit.com/r/puer/comments/k9pujs/the_story_of_w2ts_snoozefest_and_i/) that birthed it.
4. Creamy fruit juice with an astringent pull on it.
5. Silky smooth minerality with a craisin note. A nice sparkly carbonation feeling lasting on the top of the tongue. It's just a good tea that you could daily drink and feel equally fulfilled for focusing or forgetting about it and just drinking.
6. A bit watery but it's a good time in a cup. The cha qi is startin to beat at the door 
7. Fruity buttery flowers, like I just unlocked the perfume level. She's goin in the transformers playlist for sure.
8. Just drinkin it and not paying attention, it's not much different here.
9. The cha qi is hittin me like a semi slamin the breaks on black ice at an intersection
10. Watery pea protein milk
11. Light chocolate pea protein milk or somethin creamy
