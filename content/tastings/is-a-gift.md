### Infusions

1. The wet leaf after the first infusion smells a bit campfirey in a clean, savory way. The liquor came out quite light and closer to a light green tea or white peony in color. The mouthfeel is thick, oily, + juicy. The flavors are quite sweet and gentle with no bitterness, some light minerality. A strong candidate for the sweetest tea I've tried from w2t. The finish is *strongly* cooling in the mouth with some vaporous florals and spices movin around in the mouth. There's a savory aftertaste reminiscent of a bright mao feng.
2. Smells like a summer night out by the pool with the smell of flowers blooming. This round has a large kick-up in astringency but it's not overbearing. Bright, fruity, and floral. Still super sweet. A gentle touch of mineral bitterness on the sides of the tongue - this is the type of bitterness I love.
3. Frosting, lemongrass, dried flowers. The lemongrass comes through quite clearly with a touch of a smokey mineral backing. The smell in the cup is also lemongrass and coriander - kind of like fruit loops. Deep into the finish still has that savory green tea, mao feng note to it.
4. The processing definitely seems to be on the greener side. Notably more floral and soupy with some vegetal, mineral bitters. The finish is cooling and sticks around at a low volume.
5. Soupy and thick. Bright and sweet. That lemongrass aroma is still sitting in there. A bit more earthy on the vegetal/fruitiness. Kind of like taro. Nice balance on the body with the astringency puckering enough to make you wanna brew another cup. Very sessionable easy-drinker. The finish is lasting longer with a rolling sweetness that reminds me of the [Yiwu Gouyoulin](https://puerh.wtf/sessions/2021/03/yiwu-gouyoulin/) I reviewed.
6. The liquor is cloudier. Smooth all-around with a bit of astringency drippin off the bottom.
7. ...
8. Sweeter and juicier but sticking true to that soupy fruity thing. The lemongrass flavor is a bit more ambiguous and less direct, with coriander taking the clarity spotlight
