The pressing of this cake was done in 2013 but is believed to contain Banzhang-area 2003 material blended with a bit of newer material.

### Infusions

1. Maltier aroma on the wet leaf than in the rinse - more grains and Kahlua. Strong, thick mouthfeel with a vaporous and humid kinda thing goin on. Lots of aromatics on the breath. Cooling on the roof of the mouth and midway back on the top of the tongue. Gentle bitterness that's really pleasant, pairing into a wild blueberry taste. Some oats, granola, and light vanilla flavors as well as brighter florals fluttering around. Some muted, salted dark chocolate notes as well. Very low astringency. The finish begins cooling and gently becomes tingly and effervescent with a lengthy duration and persisting coolness.\

   As the liquid cools, I'm noticing more of a mint chocolate chip/brownie thing going on. The flavors and mouthfeel are both really pleasant and well-balanced. This passes the mom test for sure.
2. Wet leaf took on a deep, dark lumber kind of smell - like mahogany + rhubarb. This is a couple notches more intense in flavor and particularly more resinous and nutty than the first infusion. Salted caramel, good shit, and nice things, wet stones.
3. Bittersweet brownie with chocolate creaminess and sweetness throughout the mouth. Strong minerality. As it cools, more fruity and floral aspects come forth, like blueberries and raisins. The finish has oats and the cooling factor.
4. Wet leaf has some paper and crayon smells. Brew tastes like lemon, a bit smokey, and floral. A bit astringent. Still lots of chocolatey notes.
5. Sourness is fading away and revealing more deep forest notes with a hint of dark wood on top of earthy chocolatey tones and tobacco. Bitterness evoking *huigan* with minerality.
6. Smooth and thick liquor. Brewed a bit lighter relative to previous infusions. A bit more papery. Tastes like books. Bitterness is much more dampened down which makes it more pleasant to our personal tastes.
7. The liquor is has a more reddish hue. Daes thinks it looks like a bear would enjoy it. Tastes vintage. The smell off the liquor is quite fragrant. Drinking plain water makes the *huigan* very apparent. 
8. Quite sweet with a clearer nuttiness and freeze-dried corn-like taste.
9. Smokey bittersweetness with more sweet and cream than bitter. Papery/mineral bitters.
10. Rhubarb 86%, Paper 14%
11.
