### Synopsis

Sweet n savory with a bit of a chocolate/fruit note. Leaves a bit of a mineral fall rain aftertaste with a sweet huigan. The profile on this tea is definitely in the complex spices/sweets area. I notice some pluminess, sweetened cream, and light astringent wood.

The further in, the spicier and wood-forward this tea becomes. The astringency also starts to come out more. There's a bit of an evergreen-like taste.

Clear brothiness becomes prominent later in the session with a sticky sweetness lingering into and through the finish. Nice general sheng flavors with a full body that makes for a solid experience.

Earthy and creamy towards the end.
