God damn this thing's like an iron brick, almost bested my pick. The leaves leave a lot of funky wet piled smells on ya fingies too.

### Infusions

1. The liquor has a bit of a hazy texture to it. Mouthfeel is juicy, not as thick as I was expecting. First impression is that this is a solid daily drinker with a really good price to performance as something you could just grab and go with. Taste stays pretty true to the nose; notes of raisin bran and breakfast cereals. An ever-slight bitterness on the sides of the tongue that would easily go covered up because of the intensity of the body flavors. That bitter note produces a bit of a *huigan* that resolves before the flavor lets up, bringing forth some sweetness. A bit of a menthol and camphor in the finish.
2. The leaves opened up like a drunk guy at an AA meeting. Shit's black as a bear. Now there's much more of a solid mouthfeel there. Dark-roasted coffee notes, bran, cacao nibs. The menthol in the finish is now competing with more complex flavors but is still present. It's a refreshing contrast to the dark heaviness.
3. Fruit sugar sweetness. Some pleasant wet-piled flavors that fit in with the bran flavor. Very intense on the bass notes.
4. Mouthfeel is creamier. Large on the bran notes.
5. Aromatics largely diminishing but there's a savory core flavor still. Quite silky feeling on the tongue.
6. Similar to before with a bit less punch.
7. Bumped the water up to boiling and got a more pleasing mouthfeel and bound core to the tea. Earthy, deep notes.
8. More noticeable umami, nice minerality, your standard well-done shou tastes
