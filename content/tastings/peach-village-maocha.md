### Synopsis

Sweet with some mao feng-like vegetation/greenness lingering on top. Normally that aspect annoys me and feels indicative of the tea being in the *sha qing* process for too long, but in this case, the tea is incredibly well-balanced. I'm noticing a sweet, milky coating throughout the mouth which is very lubricating. The flavor is milk-forward as well. There's some complex funk in the middle of the body which adds to what I would perceive as a bit spicy/animalistic but not in the green tea umami spectrum - a trait I really enjoy in a sheng. The mouthfeel is very rounded without abrasion, even well into the finish. Light, minty coolness rises in the finish.

There's a little more bite as the session builds. More minerality is coming through which adds some edges to the roundness in the mouthfeel. I notice more herbal notes.

The third infusion is bringing out more floral notes, particularly ginger flowers and orchids.

Increasingly astringent and vegetal as the session progresses. Not losing the milkiness but the astringency and greenness cuts the perceived intensity of the cream note.

Medium intensity body and mind cha qi that feels a bit cold. 

Peach/orange sherbet towards the end of the session with some mint. Great tea. The mouthfeel is quite heavy.
