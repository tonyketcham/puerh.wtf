### Words and things

The wet leaf between the rinse and the first steep are a world of difference. A hidden, freshly chopped woody stem smell became unleashed and took over the delicate sweet, chocolatey, perfume smells of the rinsed leaves, bringing about a sheng funk.

The first steep has a push of umami paired with sweet caramel and fresh rain. This material is surprisingly sweet and caramel candy-like. Smooth as a bug on a rug. You'd be surprised at how clear the caramel note is, it's surprising that tea can exude such a meandering range of flavors.

The wet leaf has changed tone again to a spicy & nutty men's cologne. I'd wear this. Someone needs to make an Yiwu sheng *eau de toilette*.

Infusion 2.0 - more minerality and vegetal notes come out with a tint of tannins in the back of the mouth, still overtaken by softness and smoothness. A bit more complexity butting elbows with the caramel we saw in Act I.

Astringency builds as the session progresses. Tons of fresh summer rain. A bit of a guava/dragonfruit type beat at the top. *Huigan* is hittin, with a juicy, lasting coolness.

Bitterness is increasing with more funk and a creamy background.

Floral bitters with a satisfying basil finish that lasts for over half an hour.
