### Infusions

1. There's a noticeable smoke on top of a smooth, sweet body. The woodiness you might expect from an aged, dry stored sheng but not overpowering. Nice finish with a light astringency.
2. The smell of wet firewood. Even smoother than the previous infusion, highly oily. Quite spicy, reminiscent of cloves with menthol into the finish. Touch more of astringency.
3. An herbaceous twist with an overall spicy character backed by wood, like oak. Reminds me of a smooth bourbon. 
4. I like this smokey cacao aroma. It's subtle but characteristic. The storage on this tea is clean.
5. Much deeper and darker with some hints of overripe banana and mulch. This has gotten earthier compared to initially.
6. Smooth as a god damn dog. Makes ya feel all warm and toasty inside.
