This is our first encounter with The Sweetest Dew's teas with a Huang Shan Mao Feng.

### Infusions 

1. The mouthfeel is quite full, soft, and oily; quite velvety. The flavor is light and aromatic with a focus on florals and sweetness. The notable areas are floral, vegetable, and a light savoriness. The finish is also light and delicate. There's a nice all-around sweetness.
2. The finish is much more savory and sticks around longer. The body is also a bit more nuanced and bolder. Still a lot of sweet florals, as well as sweet dew. A bit of minerality reminiscent of copper and some pleasant bitterness.
3. Really delicate and floral-forward with tons of bright, volatile aromatics bouncing around at the start. Touch of bitterness but that compliments the delicate aspect very well. Kind of reminds us of refreshing lemon cucumber water. Not as savory as the previous infusion.
4. The sweetest it's been so far. As refreshing as the first infusion but in a different, sweeter way. The mouthfeel is thick, comfy, and much clearer on this infusion. The flavor has some freshly bruised herb scents like bush basil, oregano, and mint. There's some bitterness. The florals are still there but now overtaken a bit by the herbs. On the finish, it's begun to get a bit astringent and has a sugar water feel.
5. A bit vegetable brothy - like a floral, sweet, ultra-light vegetable dashi. Noticing again the minerality, kind of like sprinkles of rock salt. The umami of the dashi flavor is apparent, too. We can tell that this is starting to close out its tab. 
6. Sugary mineral water with a good handful of umami. Some light tanginess. Certified dope time.
