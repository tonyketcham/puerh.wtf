### Infusions

1. that's wood syrup. varnish, kind of like opening an old wooden box and takin a big wiff. There's some spice and rain funk - petrichor and camphor. very sweet moving to a bit astringent and develops in a turbulent flow
2. wet leaf has that Hubba Bubba original bubble gum smell to it. spiciness strongly resemblant of hazelnut and acorns. some herbaceous and floral kind of note with a cacao aspect in the hazelnut backbone. unsweet date. like an old man chocolate milk as in the chocolate milk is an old man and has decided to share himself with us. By the way, there's an assload of wood which needs 2 be mentioned
3. the wood's calmed a little, still intense but not as forward as before. more chocolatey
4. spicy, woody cologne in the wet leaf. creamy chocolate petrichor with some camphor and hazelnut
5. raisin bran. chest cooling finish with a throat drying and pulling feeling
