### Infusions

1. A bit of light wood smokiness, some fruit mid-brightness and tangerine zest, and a pleasant complexity that spans the whole spectrum of flavor axes. There's no bitterness and low astringency. It takes a while for that astringency to kick into effect as well as for the finish to really commence, which has a cooling, honey-like nature. This is something I've come to notice about all the ZSLs I've tried so far; they all tend to have a very sustained body before gettin into a finish that just camps out in your mouth. There's a very smooth and sweet nature imparted to the liquor that's just a joy to drink.
2. The smell on the lid of the shiboridashi is very cream-like and floral - hard to compare to specifics but it's givin me some fresh laundry feelings. The taste is more mineral with that slight smokiness combining with a cream.
3. Some orchid fragrance, lots of florals with a tight floral, medicinal smokiness. Juicy and coating mouthfeel that transforms in the finish as drying/evaporating. Some more noticeable spice, and overall a well-balanced array of flavors.
4. The gentle age on this is starting to show more clearly in the taste. There's a certain aged woody tang that tastes like it's on the dry side of storage to me, but I'm no expert. That young sheng profile is still there but it seems like anything brash has been polished off while still leaving the delicate floral aspects alone. There's a full body to this one. Noticing a bit of tangy golden raisin.
5. It's really hard to describe the flavor of this honestly. It's complex but so interwoven that I'm having a difficult time pulling out specifics. Not a bad trait of this tea by any means, just wish I could do this more justice with my dumb little words. There's a strong sweetness almost like a western fruit tea blend, but impressive since that's obviously all in the leaves here without anything added in. The mouthfeel is beautiful, super silky.
6. Kind of givin me ice wine vibes to b h.
7. Some vegetal wintergreen notes with a thicc body
8. Anise, a bit in the vegetable broth territory
9. Noticing the woody aged notes again in a pleasant light. Cha qi is super comforting and makes me feel relaxed as an anxiety-free dog
10. Hit it many more times with pleasing aged, soupy stuff goin on
