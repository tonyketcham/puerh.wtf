This is a single-family production of Duck Shit Dan Cong from naturally growing 80yr old+ trees.

### Infusions

1. Oily mouthfeel. Savory white grape leading to a back of tongue/top of throat cooling and charcoal roast flavor. Very long finish with roasted honey flavors. Low dryness with the oily mouthfeel lasting through the finish. A tinge of bitterness that is balanced by the honey and fruit. The cooled wet leaf reveals a ton of floral notes that were masked by roasted notes when still hot.
2. Popcorn and white grape, rambutan balanced with light bitterness. Some more astringency. Kind of reminds me of an authentic corn tortilla.
3. Less roast and more floral, volatile notes of white grape and honey. Muscatel grape.
4. Straight up ice wine
5. Charcoal-powered ice wine with some more noticeable floral aroma on the exhale. Some vegetal funk in the aftertaste. Very cooling around the mouth and middle of the throat.
6. Some light notes of oats and vanilla on top of the roasted ice wine flavor.
7. Creamier oat milk-like flavors with a bit of vegetal bitters.
8. Very similar to the last infusion.
9. Seems to be holding this flavor on its way out and will continue drinking for about 5 or 6 infusions off the record.
