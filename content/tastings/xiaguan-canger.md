### Synopsis

There's an interesting volatile smell coming off the lid of the gaiwan after the first infusion - something similar to Lysol sanitizing spray(?) but that doesn't appear in the cup at all.

The texture is a bit chalky with the tea not fully opened up even after 2 infusions, attributed to the extremely tight pressing on these cakes. The flavors are primarily herbaceous with dry storage notes like sweet wood thyme, and sage.

Increasing woody and incense-like characteristics. Strong earthy mushroom/herb notes not akin to soil. The finish is a bit dry with those incense flavors sticking around with a mineral coating.

Elusive smoke and sweet incense are the predominate flavors. I find the body on this to be a bit lacking especially into the chalkiness of the finish. Each infusion also increases in astringency.

This tea might age into something better but currently is in an awkward state in its age and not well-balanced.
