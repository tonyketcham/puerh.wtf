Here's where I sourced my info on this tea: [YQH group orders site](<YQH group orders site>). It reads:

> Like the 2005 Cangliu and 2006 Baisuixiang, the Qixiang is a blend of the six famous tea mountains (Youle, Yiwu, Gedeng, Yibang, Manzhuan, Mangzhi). Five are in Mengla County and all six could be considered a part of the greater Yiwu area. Unlike the Baisuixiang and Cangliu this is 100% spring harvest. Also known as Chi Hsiang. 30% Yiwu, 100% gushu.

Yang's own site then states that the material used is blended from 100-400 year old trees which would mean part of that material is dashu if you consider gushu to be 250yr+. Everyone plays by their own semantic laws in the tea world. Nothing is real. Not even tea.

### Infusions

1. This ish smells like the fabric of reality. The rinse and first infusion might not have fully awoken the tea yet but it's got the aromas goin. Mouthfeel transitions to creamy albeit a bit thin up front. I'm into the flavor - it's reminding me of Town House buttery crackers. The roasty/nutty notes are particularly strong. Definitely picking up on peanuts and walnuts. The finish is intense with a strong coating almost reminding me of the after-effects of eatin peanut butter crackers. There's a chalkiness in the mouth and on the top of the tongue after finishing this round.
2. There's a wide body and hips on this one for sure. Features a slight smokiness that's integrated into a savory nutty note. Slightly bitter aged lead on some *huigan*. Not sure how to exactly describe that. Never mind I know how to exactly describe that. It's like the young bitter mineral edge that would slap you with some *huigan* tag got fossilized and replaced by a spectre of aged sheng past. Yet the *huigan* lives on and returns the contractual sweetness to which it was so obliged. I would hug this tea. I would even nuzzle it and give it an arm around the shoulder. Sorry Daes, you can at least watch. But keep your eyes on your own paper. And boy does this tea's got some paper. That brown bag from the nose is back for attention and who am I to ignore it.
3. I've been greeted by roasted & caramelized coconut cashew chunks tossed in a little paprika and spice *ad addendum*. It also tastes like tea. I think the 2yr Ohio storage aired some of the Taiwan edge off of this stuff. There aren't many wet age notes that slap me this or that way - tastes like an Old Western. It's been Americanized as is the imperial nature of this country. There's a bittersweet chocolate note coming forth to take the stand. It's good. I like what it has to say. I feel this tea in my body like I've just been read my sleeper words and have been activated to carry out what it had secretly programmed me to do. It's cooking my brain.
4. My ass has actually been taken off and handed to me. I feel like I'm in a heat wave. This one's an ass kicker and I even had an uncrustie on my stomach before I started. It's actually awesome tho. The chalkiness in the mouth is still there. The mouthfeel is broader. The cracker and nutty notes are still there. It's honestly just holding on tight to all the flavor notes and spittin em out each infusion. The finish has a bit of a strawberry banana goin on after I gave it some time to rest. There's a menthol-like sensation in the finish too.
5. More shou-like earthy flavors coming through. Pancakes, baked goods, vanilla, light fruit. A bit astringent as well without any bitterness. You can feel a bit of a puckering dryness.
6. Some mineral stuff is comin out now - a bit of flint, a tinge of iron. Tastes like civil war-era smoothbore flintlocks converted into percussion muskets, some with their barrels rifled. 
7. Noticing freeze-dried corn now but still in that shou-like realm. The cha qi feels a little weedy. My hands are cold as an iceberg. I may die tonight. Would give this a 9.175/10.0 on cha qi.
8. A fruity/floral celery note on the lid of the gaiwan. Haven't noticed a difference in taste from the last one.
9. Upped the temp to boiling to see what happens from here on out. More resinous, vegetable brothy, and woody. It's interesting the change a few degrees can have on extraction.
10. ...
11. Back to the crackers with a tight mineral smokiness and an integrated creaminess. Startin to water out but still enjoyable.
