### Infusions

1. The liquor is quite cloudy with a light yellow-gold color. The mouthfeel is medium-thick and sticky. Immediately greeted by astringency and bitterness amongst a cloud of aromatics. Lots of minerality with a well-rounded body. Sweet and floral undertones become vaporous, spicy overtones. Tons of vaporous aroma leading into the finish with a noticeable *huigan*. 
2. A bit more bitter with a savory, fruity, mineral tanginess. The *huigan* is more intense. Lots of retro-olfactory aroma and sweetness in the throat.
3. The complexity is impressive here, shrouded in a coat of pleasant bitterness. There's more upfront spice that lingers through to the finish. Ripe banana, holy basil, carrot, mineral salts.
4. Sweeter like a cream bun or somethin dope like that. There's so much complexity in the aroma that it's honestly hard to describe. Intense holy basil, cardamom, and coriander in the mix. Some Chinese medicine aroma as well.
5. Less bitterness with more fruity/sweet tones. Some brothiness comes through as well with a *very* light touch of kombu. I feel like this would be incredible in a sweet shio ramen. Really love the finish on this tea. Tastes more expensive than it is for sure.
6. The mouthfeel's heavily increased in thickness. Some chlorophyll and other vegetal notes.
7. ...
8. The herbal medicine taste is most intense here so far. Strong complexity in the brothy umami.
9. Just a damn good time tbh



### Conclusion

The price on this cake defies logic & adds to the enjoyment similar to the feeling I get when I'm drinking [Snoozefest](https://puerh.wtf/sessions/2021/02/snoozefest/). It almost feels like a gift. As an avid sampler exploring the wild world of puer, this is the first cake I might consider tonging up on or at least grabbing another cake or two of.
