I've held back, but it's finally time to indulge in the tea I've been eyeing most from Wistaria. 

### Infusions

1. The wet leaf after the first infusion brought up bamboo and alfalfa aromas I didn't detect before. The liquor is a tad hazy with some particulate and trichomes floating throughout. The mouthfeel is sublime. It's pure, light oily softness without any harsh or scratchy aspects to fight its smoothness. 

   There's a gentle, freshly-cut, old arbor sweetness that takes over after I move my focus away from the mouthfeel. It has a well-aged flavor that's very forgiving to those who might have a love-hate relationship with aged sheng. It's mellow and feels like a calm walk through a national park. The aroma wafting off the liquor as I drink is lively with an old woodsiness - with scents of florals that have moved on with age, now dried up. 

   The lingering taste in the finish is similar to holy basil and coriander, with a gently cooling, sweet n spicy complexity that persists on. This tea rewards you for paying attention with a supremely elegant shift in sensation and aroma all in the same cup.
2. Now there's more of a rounded dry cedar flavor with a more forward spicy herb aspect. Some aspects of agave syrup are going on as well which makes the liquor feel a bit thicker and sweeter than the first infusion. A slight bit of an odd undertone lightly comes up right before the finish that I can't put my finger on. The finish is intensely cooling like menthol with clove.

   Overall super enjoyable.
3. The wet leaf now has more of a soft orchid smell to it, maintaining the cedar smell as well. The taste is more in the herbal realm with less sweetness and a bit of marine umami.
4. Not as smooth as in the beginning. Now with a pronounced astringency that overarches the woodsiness. The sweetness is also dulling. Much stronger umami by prolly 2 points.
5. More resinous and umber notes with some bitterness that creates a woody/cereal-like *huigan*. After the bitterness subsides, the holy basil and coriander come back as a throat-centric aroma that sticks around forever.
6. The cream factor has been upped and balancing out the missing sweetness I was feeling for the past couple of infusions. That pairs really well with the lively cedar and umami aspects of this tea. There's a touch of the olive note commonly talked about from Wistaria storage but I find this tea to be much more towards a cedar profile with only a slight bit of olive brine/marine-like stuff - slight enough that you might not notice it unless you were familiar with people saying Wistaria stuff tends to have that storage flavor.
7. Very similar to the last one, just really noticing the aromatic finish.
8. Some vanilla in the wet leaf. Still holding out without change from the past couple of infusions.
9. Mineral bitterness kicking in - noticing a metallic-like bitter.
