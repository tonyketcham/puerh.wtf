### Infusions

1. Stupid smooth and sweet like a sugar water. Really nice mix of and custard and fruit notes. The fruitiness is gentle and bready - kind of hard to place what fruit it reminds me of. The finish is smooth, slow, and follows a more linear path rather than some bezier dropoff. There are woody varnish notes in the finish but nothing off or harsh. It's real sweet and round. The throat feel is nice and smooth.
