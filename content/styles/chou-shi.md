description: This processing style involves dehydrating Dan Cong early on to
  stop oxidation of the leaves. The material is quickly fried after picking
  before the leaves have time to wilt. This kick-starts the oxidation halting,
  which is then hand rolled a bit and finished by special dehydration machines
  to completely stop wilting of the leaves. This process results in creamy and
  floral traits similar to an Anxi Tie Guan Yin.
