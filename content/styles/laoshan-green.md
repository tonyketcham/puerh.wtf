description: "Tiny, young growth pickings which are rolled similar to Tie Guan
  Yin save for the compression aspect. The result is a loose coil with a
  characteristic dark green. Almost exclusively made using the Long Jing #43
  cultivar, exhibiting much of the same attributes of that varietal. If ya wanna
