description: A more controversially categorized tea - some consider this a raw
  pu-erh while others more of a white tea. Lateral buds are picked that would
  otherwise form new branches, often early in the season. These young shoots are
  usually then processed in much the same way as a white tea, primarily
  whithered and sun-dried without the kill-green frying process that is
  commonplace in sheng making. In my opinion, the taste is much more in white
  tea territory than sheng.
