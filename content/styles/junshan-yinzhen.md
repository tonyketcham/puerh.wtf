description: >-
  This style is most typically associated with material from a small island
  called Junshan in Dong Ting Lake, all within Hunnan. This island is
  uninhabited and contains a very limited number of government-run tea
  plantations. If the material is grown on the island of Junshan itself, it's
  possibly the rarest style of tea in the world, and can command well over a
  grand USD for 100g of finished product. As such, this is typically reserved as
  a modern tribute tea for government officials and VIPs. 


  However, some non-government owned tea gardens in the immediately surrounding area have a nearly identical terroir and produce 'Junshan' Yinzhen which can be nearly indistinguishable from the island-grown stuff, but much more affordable. A lot of this mainland material will also enter the market pretending to be island-grown Junshan Yinzhen to tap into the insane price inflation around it. Technically the mainland material is not full-on true Junshan Yinzhen, but it can be damn near.
