# Pu-erh, wtf

This is where I talk about tea

I developed a site just so I could talk about tea

things r lookin grim if it's come to this

## Features
- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) for SSG
- [Tailwind 2.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) for UI (frontend dev in progress)
- Progressive light/dark mode toggling
- [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for saying tea words, headlessly
- mmm.. [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) for: I spent all my money on tea now I can't afford hosting

## Wanna collab?
### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Turn the lights on

1. clone 'er down
2. `cd puerh.wtf` to open the folder
3. `yarn install` because these node modules don't grow on trees
4. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
5. Put stuff with your little hands
