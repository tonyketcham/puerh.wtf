# Pu-erh, wtf

This is where I talk about tea

I developed a site just so I could talk about tea

things r lookin grim if it's come to this

## Features
- Gridsome for SSG
- TailwindCSS for UI
- NetlifyCMS for saying tea words, headlessly
- mmm.. JAMstack for: I spent all my money on tea now I can't afford hosting

## Wanna collab?
### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. clone 'er down
2. `cd puerh.wtf` to open the folder
3. `yarn install` because these node modules don't grow on trees
4. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
5. Put stuff with your little hands
