## Routing Issue Demo

This branch is made so that I can get a deploy preview to show a case example of Gridsome's routing not working when an exact entry point is given as the URL to enter a Gridsome site.

# Pu-erh, wtf

So I decided to develop a site just so I could document all the damn teas I drink. How did it come to this? Where did I go wrong? Why am I spending hundreds of dollars on tea? Well hey I'll meet ya in the cart on [white2tea](https://white2tea.com),,,,, hope that thing has digital wheels cuz I wanna kickflip that bitch with a `transform: rotateX(6rad);` and watch all the samples n cakes go flyin

## Features
- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) for SSG
- [Tailwind 2.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) for UI (frontend dev in progress)
- Progressive light/dark mode toggling
- [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for saying tea words, headlessly
- mmm.. [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) for: I spent all my money on tea now I can't afford hosting

## Wanna collab?
### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Turn the lights on

1. clone 'er down
2. `cd puerh.wtf` to open the folder
3. `yarn install` because these node modules don't grow on trees
4. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
5. Put stuff with your little hands
